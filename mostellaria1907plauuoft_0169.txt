158-166] NOTES 83

The present tense (rear) is to be ascribed to the peculiar periphrasis
remarked upon in the note to 89 b, rear me dqficatam esse standing for
deficata essem (fuerim, cf. Haut. 1025), ut reor. Lorenz regards rear as
hist. pres„ like 25 ; but this seems less good.

159. euentus rebus omnibus: supply est, which is often understood
in pithy sayings of an exclamatory character, cf. 33 : ‘ everything has its
appropriate result’‚ i.e. everything must be judged by its success or

*failure3 cf. Rud. 300 sz' euentus non euenit, ‘ if success does not attend
us'. Scapha means ‘ Ι hope your bathing will be successful '.

uelut horno messis magna fuit, ‘ as for example there has been
a fine harvest this year'3 for uelut=‘ as for instance‘ cf. 705, Aul.
462, Rud. 596. For the meaning see what follows.

160 f. To Philematium’s question, ‘What has that harvest got to do
with my bathing?' Scapha replies, ‘ Not so much as your bathing has
to do with a harvest ' ; = ‘it is rather your bathing that has something to
do with a harvest’ (i. e. the harvest which she might make out of her
lover) ; the bath has enhanced her charms.

nihilo plus is a litotes z ‘ not more ' :⁴ less ’, ‘ not so much '.

161. Venus uenusta, ‘lovely Love ’ ; cf. gratas gratias Poen. 134,
amoenitate amoena amoenus Capt. 774.

162. illa, ‘of which I spoke’. The simile of 137-43 is slightly
modified: Philematium here represents the wind as well as the rain.

modestiam, ‘good behaviour’, ⁶se1f·eontr01 ' (σωφροσύνη)”; cf.
Trin. 317.

163 f. quom perpluit, ‘ whereupon love and desire trickled like rain
into my heart'. This clause is not subordinate to qua tectus fuz', as
Brix (Jahrb. 1870, p. 427) thought, nor to quae . . . detexit, but is
rather one of those cum-clauses which are in effect co—ordz'nate clauses
(so-called ‘cum inversum'). The usage is rare in Old Latin, but it
occurs in Men. 1054 quom ego accurro, Ter. Hec. 114, Eun. 633 longe
iam abieram, quom sensi.

perpluit is a perfect tense, with a long ᾗ (cf. Men. Prol. 63
plzierat); otherwise we should have a ‘di-iambic ending' of the first
colon, and this is rarely admitted in the iambic septenarius (cf. crit.
note 011 158); i. e. the first colon rarely ends like tz'bz' dabo Asin. 654,
contera‘m tua ibid. 419.

164. neque iam umquam, &c., ‘ nor can I ever again ’.

optigere, ‘put on a roof', here without an object; contrast 141.
Transitive verbs are occasionally so used in Plautus, cf. lauz' 157, and
Bacch. 1106 unde agis :⁹ (se. te), Mil. 583 irae leniunt (sc. se), Cas. 338
res habet (sc. se): so ²“acere (sc. sacra) Stich. 2 51 ‚ turbare Most. 546,
10 .

3:636. eontemp1a=contemplare; again 172, 282 ; so in 473 aucupet
=auc²cpetur3 cf. pergraeco 960, ludg'fico 832, 1151, proficz'sco Mil. 1329,
andgrbitro, opino, uenero, all of which are Plautine (old Lat.) forms for
the e onentS.

agabo, ⁴ please’‚ ‘as you love me’ ; lit. ‘ Ι will love you ’
(parenthetically). This expression is used only by women in Plautus
