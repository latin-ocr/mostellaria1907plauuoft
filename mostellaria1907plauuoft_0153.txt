rhetorical colouring (‘I did ', ‘ even so ') to the answer. For other
instances of omission of est see Most. 254 (a question), 279 and note.

34. malum. cf. 6.

qujd me curatiost? In Plautus phrases formed of esse and a

verbal substantive· m -io are equivalent to a simple verb. So tua z‘ssndzca
tiost Pers. 586= -tz'bi indicandum est· , here quzd curatio est= quor cut es
(‘ why should you mind? ²) and is transitive, governing me and quid ego
agam. The dative tibi represents the subject of the clause. Thus we
have quid tibi lzanc digito tactiost. ? ‘what right have you to lay a
finger upon this woman3’ Poen. 1308· similarly with dat. of 1st
person Quid milti scelesto tibi erat auscultatio? ‘what did I want to
listen to you for, confounded sool that Ι was3' Rud. 502: see above on
6, and cf. Aul. 423, Trin. 709.

36. ducere, ‘keep company with’.

37. mei tergi fiducia, ‘at the pen'l of’, ‘on the respons ibility οἷ’,
cf. 3Bacch. 752 mea fiducia (‘ on my own responsibility ’) opus conduxi,
et meo penculo<‘ at my own peril ⁹) rem gero. Fi‘duczam accipene is
a legal phrase, meaning‘ to accept security’ (for payment), e. g. in Cic.
Pro Flacco XXI. 51· , fiducia is that which is pledged or mortgaged
(ὑποθήκη). Here then there is strictly a legal metaphor; ‘ my back is
the secmity which Ι give to Fate in this matter '.

38. quam confidenter, ‘ with what assurance '.

fue or fu= ‘ faugh'; Grumio pretends to be sick at the insolence of

Tranio. In saying ‘ faugh’ he ‘ utters a deal of stinking breath ² (to use
the expression of Shakespeare, Jul. Caes. I. 2. 2 50); hence the impre-
cation of Tranio : cf. Pseud. 1294 f. (according to the indications in B)
PSE UD. Ful SI. l in malam crucem. PSEUD. Cur ego adflicter ?
SI. Quid tu, malum, in os ergo mihi ebrius inructas ? ‘ why the devil,
then, do you belch into my face in your drunken condition? ⁹ So too
in Cas. 727 su (or sy) is clearly an expression of disgust. sy, sy, foetet
tuos mihis s,ermo ‘yo our talk is sickening to me' In Ter. Ad. 41² plzy
(A, probably the same word) has a weakened sense, ‘pooh‚ pooh'
(=‘ no, no ’); but this too is covered by the definition of its meaning
given by several grammarians, who describe it as an ‘interiectio re-
spuentis’ : cf. the Greek φῦ (different from φεῦ) in Aristoph. Lysistr

39. obolmsti alium, ‘I have caught a whiff of garlic in your breath',
lit.‘ you have reeked of garlic’. For the cognate accus. (alium) cf. 42,
278, Men. 170 ME. de olet? PE. Furtum, scortum ‚prandium, Truc.
131. The perfect tense refers to the emission of breath which accom-
paniedfue (38)· cf. Amph. 321 ME. olet homo quidam malo suo. S 0
ei, numnam ego obolui? ‘has he got scent of me?', Cas. 814, Men. 384
oboluit marsuppzum lzuzc,‘ she has got scent of the purse'. Oboluzsti
alium is similar in sense though not in construction (for oboleo is an
intransitive verb) to ἐμοὶ τυροῦ κάκιστον ἀρτίως ἐνήρυγεν Aristoph. Vesp.
913, where note the dat. ἐμοί· cf. ibid. ¹151 ὡς θερμὸν ἢ μιαρά τί μου
κατήρυγεν.
