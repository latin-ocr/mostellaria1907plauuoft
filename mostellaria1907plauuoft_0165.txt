1 32—142] NOTES 79

‘art to be’. This usage will explain many of the cases in which the
present subjunctive is used with future sense : e. g. Most. 58 an eueniat.
For quo euenire ef. 395, and desim ὧι (Hor. A. P. 4).

133-156. Subject: the young man left to his own control (a bad ·

master) and exposed to idleness (the wind) and love (the rain).

133. nam, i. e. ⁴ Don't be surprised at my speaking about a specimen,
quo eueniat aedificatio : for', &c. The sentence is a kind of sigh over
what might have been. For this use of nam (=‘1 say this, for') cf.
874, 949, 1044, Trin. 2 5, Capt. 464. So enim 926, διο.

ad illud usque =usque eo, ‘ right up to that point of time ', i. e. the
year's military service (stzPendium) : usque, which originally had local
meaning (‘ everywhere '‚ cf. usquam, ‘ anywhere '), came to mean
‘ uninterruptedly‘3 so 449, 793, Rud. 632, Epid. 305, &c.

134. dum fui, ‘ namely, while Ι was ', is added exegetically : the dum
is not a relative adverb with illud as its antecedent; for ad illud, ‘ up to
that point of time ’ would have to be followed by a word meaning ‘till '‚
as in Rud. 812, διο. usque adeo donec.

135. inmigraui ingenium in meum, ‘ Ι (=my vieious sels) took up
my abode in my natural disposition ⁷ ; by nature, or as turned out by his
parents, Philolaches was good, like the house in 1. 107 3 the vicious sels
corresponds to the slothful tenant of l. 105. The simile necessarily
becomes a little awkward here, because the young man has to represent
both the house (1. 133) and the slothsnl tenant: but two selves are
distinguished. Plautus might have spoken of Ignauia as the slothful
tenant (cf. Livy, Praef. ξ 1 1 in. quam ciuitatem tam serae auaritia
luxuriaque immigrauerint); but he has chosen to make Ignauia the
wind which takes off the roof.—Observe the alliteration with in·-

136. ilico [=z'n loco ‘ on the spot '], ‘ straightway ‘.

oppido, lit. ‘from the bottom' [from pedem = πέδον], hence =
prorsus ‘ utterly ’; so in 165, 733, 809, Rud. 550, διο.

139. uirtutis modum, ‘ virtuous sels-control '.

140..d.eturbau.it‚ with mihi (139), ‘tore off from me‘: milzi=de
me; the dative with a compound verb, as a substitute for repeating the
preposition with its appropriate case, is the commonest of all uses os the
dative in Latin : cf. deturbabo illum de pugnaculis Mil. 334, ita omnis
de tecto deturbanit tegulas Rud. 87.

detexit a me, ‘ unroofed them from me ’, i. e. took off the roos 01
my uerecundia et uirtutis modus. For this use of detegere with the
roos as objecatecf. 162 f. detexit modestiam, and 141 optegere eam.

a me = me.

(=later) than that ’.

optigere eam, ‘ to roof it on ', ‘ to restore the roof of my modesty
and sels-control ’ : eam =uerecundiam or uerecundiam et uirtutis
modum (139). For optigere with the roof as object see above (on 140),
and compare phrases like obducere uestem, obductis tenebris, &c-
