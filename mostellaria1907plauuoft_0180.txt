argentum. The mirror is supposed to be silvered or made of silver.
The whole of this passage seems to come straight from the Greek original;
for Pliny tells us (H. N. XXXIII. 45) that silver mirrors were not in-
troduced at Rome till the time of Pompey the Great‚ and Seneca
(Quaest. Nat. 1. 17. 8) says that the daughters of a Scipio had no
costly mirrors wherewith to indulge their vanity. The allusions to
mirrors in Plautus and Terence (Amph. 442, Cure. 577, Epid. 383,
Men. 1062, Most. 6453 Ad. 415, 428) may all be dne to their Greek
originals, or they may refer to mirrors of a simplet· description, such
as the Brundusina mentioned by Pliny. Some of the mirrors referred
to by later authors, such as Varro, Lucretius, Cicero, Horace (Od. IV.
10. 6), Quintilian, Martial‚ Juvenal, were doubtless of an expensive
kind. An imitation silver mirror would have served the purposes of
the Plautine stage.
