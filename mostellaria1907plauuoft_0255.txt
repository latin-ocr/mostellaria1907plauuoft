1032-1113] CRITICAL NOTES 165

1032. Hiatus at caesura: a pause may naturally be made after immo
(‘0n the contrary ’); so 549 (before omnia).

1033. Ι have written this line as it stands in B (partly in the margin).
CD have mihi (or mi) for et me. Deludfficatust me hodie indignis
modis Bothe, edd.

1037. With hiatus at caesura justified by the pause; and also after
opsecro, before the verse—ending U — υ -.

1039. a me supplied by Palmer.

1041. For the scene heading see on 1064.

1044. Scan nc‘im ἔνης without elision: cf. on 133.

105 1-105 3. So A, as we now know from Studemund‘s Apograph.

1055—1061 found only in A, and in a mutilated condition : the italics
denote the less certain letters or emendations.

1061. Prae‘occu· may be scanned with short prae· before a vowel, ns
in classica] verse; cf. praeopta- Trin. 648, praei Rud. 1335.

1063. For the ictus e'rus mezis cf. Aul. 603, Mil. 235, 775, Poen. 901,
Pseud. 1152 (Luchs, Comment. Pros. plaut„ 1883, p. 13). For the
scansion lzz‘cquz‘dem cf. on 176.

1064. A begins a new scene here, headed TKEOROPIDES,
TRANIO, which implies that its scene heading at l. 1041 (on the lost
page) must have been TRANIO alone (with SERUos—the 1610-
written below it). Otherwise P.

’ 1073. This is the last line of the play preserved in A.

1077. Ι have inserted tu, and written aduenis sor aduenies P;
opportune mz' aduenis Niemeyer, Sj'ogren.

1081. Ι have inserted credo (parenthetical) to supply the lacuna os
the MSS.; cf. Epid. 34, 257, Cist. 625.

1086. A speech of Tranio appears to have been lost, as is shown by
the istuc idem of 1087.

1089 ff. I have sor the most part followed Ritschl; immo 1090 is
transposed from 1091, where it will hardly scan.

1093. The supposed cases of a long final syllable in igitur are all
disposed of by Jacobsohn’s law (see Pref. p. vi): Most. 393, 1093 (cf.
376), Amph. 409, Bacch. 89, Merc. 901 ; Amph. 719.

1096. Scan ego': cf. Mil. 142, Aul. 457, &c.

1098. Either scan with hiatus (after uolo) or read with Schmidt illisce
(cf. 510) for illi P.

1100. So the MSS. (P). In the present state of our knowledge it is
safer to leave uis serere as it stands, though the scansion is uncertain:
m's serere5 (with short rise before the verse-ending ῦ - υ -, cf. on 601,
984) or uls sere‘re: cf. Radford in Trans. qs American Phil. Assoc.
XXXIV, p. 66 ; Editors since Bothe have transposed the words:
serere uis.

1101. metzzculosus is the form and prosody of the word as attested by
the two passages of Plautus in which it appears, here and Amph. 293 :
correct Lewis and Short.

1 110. Scan with hiatus at the diaeresis.

1113. hodie inditus (inuitus) destinant tibi P cannot be restored
