8-13] NOTES 63

‘ my spleen is burst’ 3 bnt the form διαρρηκτός is not actually found in
Greek. In Latin dierectus is generally used predicatively with a verb
of motion, as here and 8503 the nom. sing. is found in all three genderS,
abin dierectus? Merc. 756, quin tu i dierecta :⁹ Rud. 1170, quin quiescis
dierectum cor meum ac suspende te? Capt. 636 (so the MSS. ; for the?
at the end of these passages see on Most. 815). In Men. 442 we have
the accus„ ducit lembum dierectum nauis praedatoria.

9. em, ‘ take that!‘ (striking him). This word, which has nothing
to do with the interjection lzem, is probably a shortened form of the
imperative eme, ‘take', as shown by Stowasser (Z. f. ὃ. G. 41, 1087).
We have the full form eme in Mil. 687 eme, mi uir, lanam unde tibi
pallium . . . conficiatur, ‘take the wool ¹ or ‘ here is the wool ’ (not ‘ buy
the wool ¹) 3 see Skutsch (Philol. 59, p. 498). For this sense of emere
cp. Asin. 72, 673 and the compound adimere ‘to take away '. The
sense ‘take ’ may easily become quasi-interjectional, = ‘ there ! ’ In
English we have an example of an imperative becoming an interjec-
tion in the dialectical ‘ta’(=‘ take')‚ and also in the word ‘lo ’, which
is a shortened form of ‘look’ (see my note on Rud. 463, ed. min.‚
and H. Bradley in the New Oxford Dictionary). For other instances
of em standing alone see Capt. 570 aspice ad me. TY. em, ‘behold‚
I am looking’, Pseud. 1318, Cas. 213 quid est? CL. em, ‘see there!'
cf. Most. 297, 314, 333, 804, 1180.

1 1. quia uiuis, ‘ because you exist '‚ ‘your very existence is enough ἐ
i. e. to strike a sellow like you needs no special justification ι Ussing
compares Cas. 227 uxor me excruciat quia uiuit, ‘ my wise is a torment
⁶ to me because she won’t die ¹: cf. too the use of uiuitur in reply to the
question quid agitur ,Ρ ‘how are you getting on? ’ (uiuitur, ‘ I am existing
somehOW,’ Pers. 17), and the emphatic uiuit which appears again and
again in Cicero's Catilinarian orations, e. g. I. 2 senatus haec intellegit,
consul uidet .· lzz'c lamen uiuit3 I. 5 interfectum te esse, Catilina, con-
uenit .· uiuis.

12. quem comes, ‘ whose substance you are devouring’ (οὗ τὴν οὐσίαν

κατεσθίεις), cf. Pseud. 1 126 iamne illum comessurus es? In the verb edo ’

and its compounds (comedo, &c.) Plautus and 1Το101100, like the writers
of the classical age (see Postgate in Class. Rev, XVI. p. 110) use the
short forms exclusively; thus come's, comestis, Most. 559, Trin. 250,
Truc. 593, estis (comestis) Truc. 1553 imperative es Cas. 248, Mil. 677,
Pseud. 139, este Most. 653 infinitive esse (comesse) 14, 959, Capt. 463,
Trin. 259, Men. 628, 918, 919 ; in the passive we have estur Most. 235,
Μ11. 24, Poen. 835. The forms edim, edis, edit, &c.‚ are always sub·
junctive in Plaut. (equivalent in meaning to e‘dam, &c.‚ though different
in origin); perhaps they were the only forms of the subj. which he
employed (cf. however the MSS. in Poen. 534 edas, Stich. 554 edant).
13 f. ueri simile . . . ut. The zet-clause depends on uerisimile and
uerum, as in the phrases uem-imile est ut and uerum est ut: ‘ what you
say is neither likely nor true, that any one should be able to devour any one
else in his absence! Goetz and Schoell put a colon at frutex and make
l. 14 an independent question (‘ how could any one’, &c.). But this is
