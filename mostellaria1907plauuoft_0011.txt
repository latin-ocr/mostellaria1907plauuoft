PREFACE vii

in cases where some kind of synizesis may be assumed.
For example, rny ictus on the u of quattuor in l. 630 is
meant to indicate merely that -ίάον forms the rise (or arsis)
of the first foot‚ not that quattuor is to be pronounced as
three full syllables with the accent on the second. It cannot
be too clearly understood that ictus-marks are not indications
of word-accent or sentence-accent, but merely a means of
dividing lines into feet or dipodies. They serve, in fact, the
humble obJect of helping the reader to scan, though they
may and do indirectly furnish evidence of the incidence of
word-accent and sentence-aecem.

In the revision of the proof-sheets Ι have had the assistance
of two friendS, one of whom, alas is no longer among us.
Professor O. Seyffert of Berlin, with characteristic devotion,
read part of the proof as it was going through the press,
inspite of the fact that he was suffering from the effects
of a paralytic stroke. The comments which he was able to
send me before his death in July of last year were not many,
but they were of great value. Professor Postgate has most
kindly read the whole of the explanatory notes and made
several helpful suggestions which Ι have embodied‚ some-
times with a reference to his name. And to the Reader of
the Clarendon Press I am indebted for the thoroughness with
which he has done his work.

As in my Rudens (ed. min), the text is interleaved to
facilitate the collecting of notes and comparison of instances.
