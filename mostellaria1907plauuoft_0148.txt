62 MOSTELLARIA [με

1. Grumio‚ who has come at daybreak from his master's farm in the
country and is standing iu the street, outside the house where Philo·
laches dwells, calls to Tranio, who is within. This is an excellent
scene, opening up the whole situation, and taking the place of a pro-
logne. Tranio regards Grumio as a spy, who will inform against him
on the return of his master from abroad. This scene may be compared
with the opening scene in the Casina (though that play has a prologue),
in which a country-slave and a town-slave exchange objurgations. The
Epidicus and the Persa also open with dialogue between two slaves;
but it is of a friendly character. In the Truculentus we have also
a country-slave, named Stratulax‚ who explicitly threatens (l. 313) to
lay information about the profligacy of Diniarchus. Inhabitants of the
place at which the scene of action was laid, or its neighbourhood,

entered the stage by the door to the right of the spectators: see Intr. .

p· mezi, ‘come out '; cf. is 547 : in Aul. 40 exi is ‘get out ’.

sis, ‘ will you?' lit. ‘if you will '‚ ‘ if you please', contr. fr. si uis,
as Cic. (Or. XLV. 154) says. Sis is often used in Plaut., where the
feeling is the reverse of polite ; cf. 569 Abi sis, belua, Aul. 46.
2. inter patinas, ‘ among the platters ' = in the kitchen.
argutias, ‘ glibness of tongne ', ‘powers of repartee'3 cf. argutias
exordiri aduersus aliquem Bacch. 1 27, argutam‘er Amph. 349.

3. permirum, a by·f0rm of pernicies, often found in good MSS.
(e. g. Pseud. 364); cf. Munro on Lucr. Ι. 451, Marx on Lucil. 76.

4. si uiuam (fut), ‘if I live’ (i.e. ‘ if I shall live'): si uiuo 1067 is
perhaps different; see note.

probe strengthens the verb, ‘I will revenge myself properly';
ulcisci probe recurs in 1179, Poen. 1228. For probe in other connexions
cf. 342, 473, 736, 870, 1067, 1108.

5. nidor, e pupina‚ an emendation by Lowe (Analecta Plaut.
p. 215) 3 nidor is supposed to be a term of abuse (vocative) = ‘ reek’
or ‘ stench ’ ; and pupina a vulgar form of popina, in the sense of ‘ uilis
et sordida coquina.' But see critical note.

6. Enter Tranio from the house of Theoropides (represented at the
back of the stage: Intr. p. ix).

malum, ‘interiectio stomachantis' Lambinus. (quid malum?
‘why the mischief?') It is found only in questions3 cf. 34, 368,
Aul. 429, Capt. 531, Men. 390, Mil. 446.

quid tibi clamitatio est? lit. ‘what is your bawling?' = quid
(quor) clamites? ‘what business have you to bawl?’ ‘what do you
mean by bawling? ’ This use of the verbal snbst. in -io‚ esp. in angry
questions, is a very favourite idiom in Plaut.; cf. 377 and see further

- on 34.

8. abi dier-ecte, ‘go to the devil ἐ dierecte is either the vocative of
dierectus or an adverb formed from it. The origin of dierectus is
uncertain; perhaps it is ‘ some bastard issue of διαρρὴγνυμι ’, as the late
Professor H. Nettleship thought: cf. the common imprecation'in Greek
comedy διαρραγείης, ⁸ split you ’. In Cure. 240 lien dierectus est means
