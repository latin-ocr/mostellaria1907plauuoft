INTRODUCTION

Tm: Mostellaria1, like other plays of Plautus, is founded
on a Greek original: this was called Φάσμα, ‘The Ghostj
as we leam from the didaskalia, or notice appended to the
play by the grammarians (see p. xix). There were several
plays of this name belonging to the νέα κωμῳδία; probably
the one in question was written bXAEQQm0,ss²‚ from whom
Plautus also borrowed the plot of his Trinummus and Ἠετ-
cator. Whether the Phasma Catulli, a mime of the early
empire mentioned by Juvenal VIII. 186, had any connexion

with any of these earlier ghost-plays is not known.

The scene is laid in a public street in Athens (cf. 30, 66,
1072) in which stand the houses of Theoropides (or Theo-
propides3) and Simo. The action lasts from early morning⁴
till late in the asternoon : cf. notes on Ι. 1, Ι. 2, Ι. 3, I. 4, and
lines 579 redito huc circiter meridiem, 651 iam adpetit meri-
dies, 966 uide sis ne sorte ad merendam quopiam deuorterzlr.
Between the two houses, which occupy the back of the stage,
is the opening of a narrow side-street (angiportum, cf. 1046),
employed in several passages of the play as a place from
which the conversation on the stage may be overheard. The

¹ The word is a feminine adjective derived from mostellum, the
diminutive of monstrum : Mostellaria (sc. fabula) then means ‘ A Ghost-
St(3511. so, the date of the composition of this Φάσμα falls between the
years 289 and 262 B.c. The latter is the year of Philemon's death3
for the former see note on line 775 (cf. on 1149), and Hueffner, De
Plauti comoediarum exemplis Atticis (Gottingen, 1894).
