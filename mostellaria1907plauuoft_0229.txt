porro serere negotium, ‘give occasion sor further bother ’.

1101. metuculosa, ⁴ ticklish’, as we should say. Note the impu·

quaesti. The gen. in -125 of substantives of the 4th decl. is
unknown to Plautus and Terence x thus we find also senati, sumpti,

ita. mali hercle, ⁶ so devilish close ', i. e. there would be no room
for him.

1108. perii. Theoropides casts aside the mask and gives vent to his
