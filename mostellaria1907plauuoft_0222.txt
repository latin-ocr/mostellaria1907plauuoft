134 MOSTELLARIA [959-974

959. esse et bibi. The combination of active and passive infinitives
in this and the following lines, dependent upon intermissum est (cs. on
desitum est 958), is lax writing; so too the repetition of ducere after
duci: but similar awkwardnesses are not unexampled in Plautus ς
cf. 19 .

9609. duci: cf. on 36.

pergraecari: deponent, as in 22, 643 though there would not be
much difficulty in regarding it as passive, cf. on 166, 371.
961. iggaec, ‘ what you say ‘; cf. istic (964), ‘in that house (by which
ou stan .
y 963. pergam porro percontarier: cf. 63 and sor the alliteration 32.

965. praeter speciem stultuS, ‘ more of a fool than you look'.

966. uide ne = ὅρα μή ‘ see to it that . . . not ', i. e. ⁴ I suspect that '.

merenda: probably a light asternoon meal, like the modern Italian
merenda. The only other passage of Plautus in which the word appears
is Vidul. 50 ff. Nl. nec milti nisi unum prandium quicquam duis praeter
mercedem. DJ, quid merendam :⁹ NI. ne duis, neque cenam: here the
merenda is spoken of as different from both the prandium and the cena,
and this is confirmed by the definitions of the word given by Nonius, p. 28
(who quotes a fragment of Afraniusss‚,and Isidor. XX. 2. 12 : so Calpurnius,
Idyll. V. 613 though Festus, 250 b, 8 f. identifies merenda with pran-
dium5 cf. Mare. Aurel. in Fronto, Epist. IV. 6. A certain time may
well be supposed to have elapsed since the interview with the danisla
xiam adpetit meridies 6 51) and the prandium of Simo 690 ff.

967. ampliuscule, ‘somewhat too freely'. The adverb is used by
Sidonius, Epist. III. 16, and the adj. by Apuleius, a great imitator of
the language of Plautus (De Magia, p. 32²· 19): it does not occur
elsewhere in Plautus, but may be paralleled by meliusculus Capt. 959,
968, Cure. 489, plusculas Pers. 21, saepiuscule Cas. 703.

968. ne: i. e. uide ne, ‘ I suspect ‘.

alias aedis, ‘ the wrong house '.
perperam, ⁴ by mistake '.

969. qua oportet . . ‚quo uenerim. For the change of mood see
199 and on 149 and 254 ; cf. Amph. 17 quoius iussu uenio et quam ob rem
uenerint, ibid. 346, Bacch. 736.
