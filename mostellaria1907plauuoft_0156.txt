το MOSTELLARIA [56-63

Romische Pn'vatalterthiimer, v. 1. 193 s.—It should be observed that
this is one of those passages in which Plaut. describes Roman manners
and stoms, though the scene is laid in Greece; cf. on 22. Greek
id not treat their slaves in this way.
abunt . . . si reueniat, a common form of conditional sen·
Plautus; e. g. Amph. 450, Asin. 414, Aul. 311, Poen. 729,
. Od. ΙΙΙ. 3,. 7f., Verg. Aen. Ι. 372 ff„ VI. 882 f. The
‚ oldpgffipgcfntvhee fgffirroortgggffg. (so here), indefinite (cf. aliqui
174, quique 2 54), or relative (so 266) pronoun‚ very common in Plautus.
qui scis an, ‘ how do you know whether . . . ’ --‘ maybe ’, cf. haud
selggngggiogilgyoperam conpendi face, ‘ spare yourself the labour

   
   
  

² of a speech '‚ cf. Pseud. 1 141 operam fac conpendi quaerere, ‘ save your-

self the trouble of asking ’ ; for operam cf. Bacch. 994 aurium operam
tibi dico, ‘ I promise yon the service of my ears ' (i. e. to listen)‚ and the
common phrase, operam dare, ‘to be at the service of’. For conpendi
face, cf. on Capt. 965: face is a common form os the imperative in
Plaut., cf. Aul. 153, Trin. 800, Men. 946; but fac is also found e. g.
Pseud. 1141, Trin. 1008; so dice Capt. 359, dic Truc. 941 3 duce Most.
324, 794, 843, Trin. 384, duc Aul. 362, Amph. 854.

61. mala re magna mactari, ‘ to be favoured with a fine flagellation ⁹.
Note the alliteration‚ and cf. 352, Aul. 483. Malo et damno mactare
with 300. of object ‘to load with misery and loss' occurs also Aul.
535 : Postgate suggests that te macto infortunio (Trin. 993, Amph. 1034,
Ter. Phorm. 1028) means lit. ‘ I magnify (or bless) you with missortune ';
sor maclare comes from mac-tus ‘ magnified ’ (connected with mag·nus);
cs. augustus from augere. The sacrificial sense ‘ to immolate ' may arise
from a euphemism, such as is common in this connexion. On mala ree,
‘ punishment’‚ cf. 700, 858, 867, Aul. 483, Trin. 63.

62. Here Grumio states the real object for which he has come: the
plural estis refers to Tranio and the whole household over which he

resides.

p 63. The sense is : ‘ if you can satisfy my legitimate demands, satisfy
them; if not, then go to the devil to your hearts' content : ’ cf. exactly
the same turn of expression in Poen. 511 quin si ituri hodie estis, ite,
aut (‘or else ') ite hinc in malam crucem :⁹ Cf. also Cas. 831 date ergo,
daturae si umquam estis hodie uxorem, Cist. 378 quin is, si itura es ?
Rud. 181-3, Τ1110. 149 s.; sometimes instead of ‘ give if you are going
to give’ &c., Plautus says ‘ are you going to give (or not)? ' e. g. Most.
604 f., Truc. Prol. 4 daturin estis annon :⁹ cf. T. Quinctius Atta
(Aedilicia) daturin estis aurum?

si non estis, sc. daturi.

agite pergite is the plural form os age perge Cist. 554, cf. Cure.
88 agite bibite, ‘ come drink ’ ; so in Greek ἅ-γε and ἄγετε.

porro, ‘further '‚ cf. 613, Rud. 653 quid illum porro praedicem ?
‘what shall I call him further?‘ and the common phrases loquere
porro, ausculta porro: thus porro pergy‘te means ‘ go on ⁹, go ahead'‚
