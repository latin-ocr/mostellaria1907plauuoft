PERSONAE] ’ NOTES 61

. Callidamates isa further (Plautine) development of Καλλιδάμας, ‘he
who subdues by beauty‘² ‘-Lady killer' 3 cf. δαμάτειρα. The penultimate

is short, as Crain showed (cf. ἀδάμᾶτος, δαμᾶσίφρων), not long as Ritschl

assumed. In 311, 37 3 we might scau with long or short penult3 cf, 341.

Sphaerio. This name rests on Seyffert' s elever emendation in 419,
where see crit. note. Σφαιρίων is obviously formed from σφαῖρα, a ball
used in games, and is thus eminently suitable to a boy-slave τ ‘ Pill '.

It is uncertain whether the name of the father of Philolaches is
Theorepides or Theopropides. The latter, accepted by all editors
since Bergk, has the advantage of being an actual Greek name, found
in Pausanias Χ. 9. 2 and in inscriptions. But iu the MSS. the form is
generally either T keoropz‘des (so A, four or five times) or T lzeuropz'des (so
P, sixteen times) ε the only traee of a p before the r is in 784 and 962,
where B has Theupropides. (We also find -tropides as the last part of
the name in two scene headings, ΙΙΙ. 1, ΙΙΙ. 2 according to B and D.)
Either form suits the metre, except in 784, where Thffi‘ro‘pides suits
perfectly and leffiprb‘pffdes does not : nor is it possible to emend the line
without doing violence to the bacchiac metre. This fact seems decisive
in favour of Τ Ιιεονὸρῑἰίες. Many Plautine names are coinages of Plautus
or his Greek original, and not actual Greek names: Θεωρωπίδης may
possibly be a patronymic formed from Θεωρώπης, a compound of θεωρο-
‘ spectator of shows', and -ωπης, ef. κυν-ὡπης, ‘dog-faced '. ‘ Spectator-
faced ’ = ‘ Facing the show ‘ seems quite suitable to the character of the
old man ; cf. 427 f. ludos ego hodie . . . lzic senz'faciam‚ ‘ I will give the
old man a show ’—-the show being the trumped up story of the ghost.
The unaccented second syllable would of course be shortened before the
accented syllable w hich follows Theffroszdes) cf. ξεὸιηέίνες (γεωμέτρης)
in Juv. III. 76. ι’

Pedisequi, see 11. v

Danista, a latinize2d form of the Greek δανειστὴς, cf. poeta from
ποιητής, sucophanta from συκοφάντης, mastzgz'a from μαστιγίας, &c. It
is not certain whether Misargyrides, which occurs only in 568, is
intended as the real name of the money-lender or as a nick-name
invented for the occasion by Tranio3 it is a patronymic formed from
μισάργυρος (cf. μισαργυρία), and is probably to be regarded as a comic
modification of Φιλαργυρὶδης, which would have been flat and unin-
teresting. Or possibly the μισ· is intended to apply to the man (‘ hate-
ful usurer ’, ‘ Macmoneygrub ’).

Phaniscus‚ from φᾶνός, ‘ torch ’ (so Schoell)‚ is suitable to an aduor-
sz'tor, who comes to fetch his master home at night (see on aduersum
uenire, 313) ; compare the names Lampadio and Lampadz‘scus (Cist.).

Pinacium (traces of which name were discovered by Studemund in
the heading of IV. 1 in A) is the latinized form of πινάκιον, ‘ writing
tablet ’ (hence suitable for an aduorsz‘tor who has to bear his master's
appointments in mind), or ‘picture ’‚ i.e. beautiful as a picture.
