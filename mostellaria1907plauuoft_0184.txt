ment to Philematium.

oculus meus is addressed to Philem„ cf. 325. The nominative

SCENE 4, SECOND CANTmUM. This Canticum falls into three divi-
sions (for metrical analysis see critical note) :-(A) 313-319, Solo of
Callidamates: (B) 320-335, Duet of Delphium and Callidamates ;
this is a very effective passage, full of life and humour: (C) 336-347,
Quartette of the above with Philolaches and Philematium. Altogether
this scene must be regarded as one os the most vigorous in Plautus.

Enter Callidamates from the town (right), aecompanied by his sweet-
heart Delphium and his attendants, Phaniscus and Pinacium. The
former is his favourite slave, the latter in bad odour. Callidamates has
just lest another wine party, and has already drunk deeply. Yet it is
still the forenoon ; the first drinking party must have been atempestiuum
conuiuium with a vengeance. It is now his intention to spend the rest
os the day in carousing with his friend Philolaches, His first words are
addre-sed to his attendants, with whom he has taken his stand in the
front of the stage. Philolaches and Philematium stand in the back-
ground, and take no part in the conversation till 336.

313. aduersum uenHeere 876, 880, &c. >‚‘ to come (go) to setch’.
These slaves appear again later on (858, 885 a) as aduorsitores.
The passive ueniri is impersonal.

314. em, ‘take that' (striking Pinacium); cf. 9.

tibi imperatumstf you 've got your or'ders’.

316. male taesumst, ‘got hombly bored' ; for the adverb of
cognate meaning to the verb or adjective cf. cupide petas 73, umide

952; di te bene ament Capt. 138, perspzcue palamst Aul. 188, &c.

317. comisatum, supine of comisari ειιιίιη,ιάζειιι,ι to revel'.

318. hilari ingenio, ‘in merry humour’. The adj. is elsewhere ,
helarus, not hilaris, in Plautus, e..g Rud. 420 mea lepida, lzzlara.

319. 1113.- -·m ma· -madere,‘ to be ti· ti· -tipsy’ . Note the humour of
making him stumble over the word madere. In the drunken scene in
Pseud. 1285-1297 a similar effect is given by the phrase nma'ide
madere (sor the adverb of cognate meaning see on 316). Cf. Rud. 528—38.
