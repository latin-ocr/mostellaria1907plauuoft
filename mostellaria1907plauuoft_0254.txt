precede the verb est; est haud intermissum is strange Latin for haud
intermissum est or haud est intermissum: (2) this reading brings the
syllable which would bear the prose accent into the fifth rise of the
trochaic septenarius, which ought to be formed by such a syllable; see
on 656 (explanatory note).

965.l Scan caim e⁹rb without elision in the rise of the foot; cf. 392 (in

967. >1 have written ampliuscule quam for AMPLIUSQUAM A,
melius cuiquam P. Scan sa‘tz‘sfue- as a proceleusmatic (ύυὺυ).

973 b. This line is found only in A.

974. destinatum P; A is not legible at this point.

976. Scan with hiatus after assiduo (to avoid which 1 proposed in my
first edition to insert usque before assiduo, cf. Truc. 261 ; the word was
used by Phan. in 957).

981. KEU A, eu P.

984. Ηεντιιῖἑί Lindsay (Archiv XV, p. 144), for HERCULI ΑΡ.-
For the short rise (-e) before the verse—ending ῦ-υ - see on 601, 1100.

101 2. Ι read id (quidem) multo minus, adopting the order of words
given in A (where there is room for id quidem) z or mult0<id qu)id(em)
minus, with the order given in P. B and D have a space of about
four letters between multo and id (which B writes with a capital Ι).

1018-1021. Here Ritschl supposed two lines to have been lost;
hence the numeration.

1025. The ne of P (MINAS A) is changed by all editors since
Lambinus to te; but cauere ne is a good Plautine construction, and
the subject accusative may be omitted (see on 55).

1026. After this line A has four partially legible lines (1026 b-e) not
ffound in P; and after them a whole leaf (two pages) of A has dis-
appeared, the next page beginning with 1. 1042. It follows that there
were originally thirty-eight lines of writing in A between 1026e and
104² ; for each page of A contains nineteen lines. Of these thirty-eight
lines of writing fifteen are accounted sor by the fifteen lines of text
which stand in P (1027-1041) and two were no doubt occupied by the
scene heading before 1041. Thus it appears that twenty-one lines of the
text have been lost (indicated by asterisks, p. 48 f.).
