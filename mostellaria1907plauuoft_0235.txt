22-43] CRlTICAL NOTES 147

Plautus and Terence, including A, for the accuS. plur. in the phrase
dies noctesque (dies noctes. dies atque noctes) and the equally common
noctes diesque (noctes et dics, noctesque et dies), perhaps sor the sake of
the assonauce; see on Rud. 380, ed. maior.

25. Ι have restored iit for ut P <iit Dm„ Quom it is commonet in
Plautus; but cf. Pseud. 623 quom abiit, Poen. 77, 904, 1070 quom obiit
diem. Scan iit as υυ.

31. Scan antehac as standing for a spondee ; so 731, 933.

38. fue BD, fut C, Pfuz' Ussing .—Ritschl transferred the word to the
next line (su, oboluzsti, and he is gfollowed by Gz.· Seh„ who read fusae
oboluisti ( susae -fu L’or„ Leo, and Lindsay. But the ejaculation is

oboluisti (not removed by Lorenz)‚ · it would haxe to be equivalent to
a resent.

p39. The hiatus before alcum might possibly be lemoved by inserting
mi; a dative· ιε found after olere abolere &c.,) though not side by side
with a cognate accus„ in Men. 384 oboluzt marsuppium lzuz'c,‘ she has
got scent of the purse,’ Aul. 216 aurum huic olet, ‘ he scents my g01d‚’
Mil. 41 ut praeolat mihi quod tu uelis, ‘ that I may have an inkling.’

40. The word rusticus seems too weak sor the context, but it is
supported by the MSS. and also by Donatus on Ter. Phorm. IV. 4. ²9·
Possibly we should scan it with elision os the last syllable, according to
the principle of Leo, that final s aster a short vowel may be dropped
before a word beginning with a vowel, and that thus elision may take
place : the rhythm of the verse is much improved if the dactylic
word is equivalent to two syllables (Lachmann’s law). An argument
in favour of Leo's doctrine is that it explains such common contractions
as scelestu’st= scelestus est, nanctu’s= nanctus es : bnt these are explained
by Lindsay as due to prodelision, like Engl. it's, he’s. [It would also be
possible to read the voc. rustice, side by side with hircus, asin Asin. 664
meus ocellus, mi anime, Cas. 134 f. mi animale . . . meus festus dies,
meus pullus passer . . . mi lepos]

41. cgprss or capran P. The reading is uncertain; see explanatory
note—steri is often found at the end of an iambic or trochaic line with
the first syllable long, e. g. Amph. 587, Trin. 532, Capt. 843, though
elsewhere in the line we find fieri, e. g. Amph. 69 3.

43 f. Scan tu o· as two syllables, together forming the rise of the first
foot. We cannot here speak of ‘ elision ’ in the ordinary sense, for the
o· is short. Probably the two syllables are run together in such a way
that the first preserves its identity more completely than is the case in
ordinary elision (though in no case is an ‘elided' vowel completely
suppressed). This kind of synaloepha 1s probably found not only when
the second syllable 1s short, as here and' 1n 13 3 (nam l· )‚ but also when
it is long, in cases like di m- 206, te il· ²093 see note there.

The loss of a line between 43 and 45 is assumed by Gz.· Sch. to
explain the construction of superior (sing). The words quam erus
appear only in B.
