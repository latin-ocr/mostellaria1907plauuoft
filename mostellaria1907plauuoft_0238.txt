150 MOSTELLARIA [150-210

150. 1 have indicated the loss of a verse after 150 ; a second member
introduced by neque is required. —The arrangement of the next two
lines is quite uncertain.

155 tum a me Seyffert, for tam e P (corrected to a. me B2).

158. Scaphd; for the iambic septenarius really consists of two parts
(each being an iambic dimeter —the second catalectic), like the
corresponding English metre. —

Now who be ye, would cross Lochgyle,
This dark and stormy water?
Hence the fourth foot is treated as endzng a Ιτηες its sall must be pure,
i. e. υ; its rise may be either long or short (a syllaba anceps), cf. 162,
170, 174ς hiatus is sreely admitted between the two parts of the line, cf.
230, 236; and a di· iambic ending of the first part is avoided, cf. ex·

planatory note on 164.
169. Scan mulieres as a proceleusmatic (introducing the second colon

Of ge·lipt}¹)ave inserted ea after lepzde; a u ord οι syllable has fallen out

os the line sornewhere-possibly after res, as Leo (Der Saturnische
Vers, 1905, p. 29⁴) suggests. He points out that the emendation of
Bergk—mores = ‘moods ', ‘ whims ’—accepted by all subsequent editors,
produces a line of which the rhythm is unparalleled in Plautus: ul
lepide omnis more‘s lenit (ending with ‚two spondaic words before an
iambic disyllable).

174. ob istuc Bugge, ob hoc P.-—Sean with hiatus after hodie.

176. Scan triquidem ; so siquidem 229, hrcquidem 1063. The
shortening of the first syllable may be illustrated by hb‘dz'e (from hei-die).

186. eductam Camerarius, for doctam P, cf. Cas. 194·

199. Scan uides φησί as standing for an anapaest. This is an extreme
instance, as the syllable -des is long both by nature and by position;
hence the emendation of Scioppius uide. Can it be said in view of
cases like this that Plautus ‘ scanned as he pronounced ' ?

200. As there is no justification for taking quam as= minus quam,
perhaps we ought to read ni‘mzo or mmmm for niffzlo, as Fay suggestS.
szio w=ould ni'mzo plus ‘far more’ (an exaggeration‚ but perhaps
not impossible in the mouth of Scapha)· , nimium or nemis would:
ualde“ χ Ι have been loved ever so much, just as you are now '). Seyffert
held that we have here the fragments of two lines :—

Nihilo ego quam nunc tu (minus sui pulchra et venusta, et nihilo

Minus ego quam nunc tu) amata sum atque uni modo gessi morem.

205. sumptu supplied by Bentley, who also suggested aere.—Note the
alliteration s. s. s. s. s.

226. Scan di in· as forming a disyllabic rise, rather than with elision.
This gives greater prominence to the important word di. Cf. on 43
above.

208-2-23 are regarded by most modern critics as an interpolation.
They certainly overburden the scene (already too long). Even if
written by Plautus they are very likely to have been omitted in acting.

210. Scan ille as forming the fall of the fifth foot ; the word is often
