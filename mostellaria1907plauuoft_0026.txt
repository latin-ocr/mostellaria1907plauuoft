xxii INTRODUCTION

1065. CamerariuS, the great German student of Plautus of
the sixteenth century, restored all these passages to their
proper places 3 but in one point he went too far. He
transferred the whole scene beginning Quid tibi uisumst
mercimoni (904) from its present position and inserted it
between the scene ending 857 and the scene beginning 858.
The order of Camerarius was followed by the Vulgate‚ so
that this scene bears the traditional description ΙΙΙ. 3.
Ritschl restored it to its present position, which is also
its position in the MSS.
