in a question which echoes the question of another as to a matter of fact
(indic.) cf. 906 f. Aul. 550 ME. quid est ? E V . quid sit me rogitas ?‚
&c. Contrast Most. 579 (note), 620.

557. cape cum eo unum iudicem, ‘ choose an arbitrator in agree·
ment with him ἐ for the cum see on 1142, sor unus on 691 (iv), for this
sense of iudex Rud. 1040.

aecum=aequom, ‘fair’: ef. Truc. 629 arbitrum aequom ceperim,
Cas. 966 nunc ego tecum aequom arbitrum extra considium captauero.

558. is an ‘aside'. eredat, ‘has (shall have) confidence in‘. The
comie effect is increased by the adjective aecum in 557.

559. The fox eating pears may be compared with the fable of the fox

W 560. seruom eccum. The compounds eccum, eccam, eccos, eccas,

eccillum, &c.‚ when used not parenthetically as in 83, but so as to form
a complete sentence, are often accompanied by an accuS. of a noun or
adjective, which stands in apposition to the last part of the compound;
so here seruam Tranium is in apposition to the -lzum of eccum : cf. Mil.

1216 eccum praesto militem, Bacch. 568 duas ergo lzic intus eccas

Bacchides, Cist. 743 saluam eccam ‘ here it is, safe '.

Tranium (nom. T ranius) is probably a mere by-form of Tranio ε
cf. T alasius, a by·f0rm of Talassio, in catull. 61, 134 (note of Ellis) ;
in Aristoph. Plut. 727 Πλοῦτος appears as Πλούτωνι cf. too architectus
Mil. 915, &c.‚ architecto Most. 760, Poen. 1110. Ritschl regarded
, Tranium as a neuter diminutive.

561. qui danunt (cf. 129), ‘ a pair who give'‚ referring to both
Philolaches and Tranio 3 for similar irregular plurals in relative clauses
cf. Amph. 7 31 te lzeri me uidisse, qui (‘ when we ') bac noctu in portum
aduecti sumus, Aul. 437.

562. quo te agis? Tranio and Theoropides are on one side of the
stage, the danista on the other: Tranio, now between two fires (565 et
binc et illinc), is‘ bound at any price to prevent explanations passing
between his two enemies, and leaves Theoropides (566) in order to
attempt to pacify the money-lender and induce him to go away. By
talking in a loud tone the money-lender at last succeeds in attracting
the attention of Theoropides (610). There is certainly some violation
of dramatis vraisemblance here, as Langen says. During this long
interval Theoropides has nothing to do, and must be supposed not to
hear what is going on.

,nequoqm‚ ‘nowhere ’, lit. ‘ no whither': for the long vowel of
the nZ- cf. nequam, anuaquam‚ nequiquam contrast nzuolt 110.

,χιε ego sum: cf. 75. These words and the next three and a half
