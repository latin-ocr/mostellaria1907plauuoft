CRITICAL NOTES

OCCASIONAL notes on scansion are given here, in cases likely to cause
difficulty. A knowledge of the ordinary phenomena of Plautiae prosody
is assumed. The terms ‘ rise ’ and ‘ fall ’ are here employed instead of
arsis and thesis, which have become so confused in nse as no longer
to suggest any definite idea. ‘ Rise ' and ‘ fall ’ correspond to the con-
venient German terms Hebung and Senkung—denoting respectively
the crest and the trough of a wave of sound. [See Classical Revz'ew
for April, 1906, p. 156 f., note]

P denotes the Palatine MSS. (B, C, D), minor differences being
neglected 3 A denotes the Ambrosiam, as deciphered by Studemund.

( > denote words or parts of words inserted by conjecture.

The D1DASKAL1A (p. xxiii) is restored according to Festus, pp. 162 and
305 (ed. Miiller)‚ where two verses of the Mostellaria are quoted as
taken e Plauti Phasmate.—Graeoa Φάσμα; Graeca fabula Φάσμα
uocatur.

ARGUMENT, 5. Scan with hiatus at caesura.

MoerLLAmA.

5. nidore cupinam P (culinae B2). No really satisfactory emenda·
tion has been proposed: nidoricape: nam quid (hic) lates? Ritschl,
(exi) exi, inquam, nidoricupi, nam quid lates? Lindsay, without
caesura ; and is m'dorz'cupius a correctly formed compound ?-m·dore (e)
culinae would give a satisfactory sense (cf. Juvenal V. 162, Martial
1. 93. 9), and might be paralleled by conspectu ex hominum Lucr. ΙΙΙ.
49, &c. (Neue Lat. Formenlehre 11. 944); but the place of the
preposition would be unexampled in dialogue passages of Plautus:
contrast 1. 30, where the preposition comes between a noun and its
adjective.

8. The word dierectus is always four syllables with the first long in
Plautus, except in Trin. 457 where dz’erecte is trisyllabic according to
the MSS.

9. The word em (en P) was regarded by Ritschl as standing extra
versum (l. 9); but it may be scanned as part of 1. ιο, em hocine
standing soralegitimate proceleusmatic (ὺυύυ) ; ef. sine mado 12, tibi
labet 20, &c. The word em is never ‘elided’ in Plautus, perhaps
because its disyllabie origin (eme) was still felt : see explanatory note.

21. Scan with hiatus at caesura, which is natural, as there is a pause
after erilem to show its connexion with rem. 1 have added -ραι after
affulescentemf, pgrtly to avoid hiatus at this point, partly for the sake of
t esense: c. 2 .

22. The spelling noctes, not noctis, is attested by the MSS. os
