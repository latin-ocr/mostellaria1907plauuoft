see on 522.

inscitissumus, ‘you simpleton’, nom. for voc.‚ see on 311 ; or
reaTmfczff'tzssumus. Callidamates means that to take refuge at the
altaris a tacit confession of guilt3 cf. 1098 f.

1137. utrisque disceptator, ‘as umpire (arbitrator) between the
two parties’‚ each party here consisting of one person. The plural of
uterque occurs also Truc. 151 utrosque pergnoui probe, ‘both kinds of
land‘ ; and Amph. 223 (MSS).

disputare is originally a term of account· -keeping; cf. Aul. 529
ubi dzsputatast ratzo cum argentm zo ‘when the account was settled
with the banker'. Here‘ clear up the account' = ‘argue the case'
(cf. Rud. 718), or if addressed to Callidamates‘ settle the score’ .

1138-44. The names of the speakers are omitted in the MSS„ and
there is some obscurity in the course which the discussion takes.
Theoropides apparently weakly accepts the challenge of Tranio that
he should plead his case before Callidamates. T H. ‘ You have
'demoralized my son‘. T R. ‘ He has only done as others have done
before 111111 ’. Tll. ‘I admit the force of that argument’. CA. ‘Let
me act as judge; (to Tranio) let me sit upon the altar’, i. e. a judge
ought to sit down, while the disputants stand; but the object of
Callidamates is to get Tranio out of the position of a suppliant (cf. on
1135). TH. ‘ By all means; do you undertake the case ’. TR. ‘There
lies a trap for me '; i.e. if 1 once leave the altar, you will seize and
punish me3 this was no doubt the intention of Th. in 1144. (See
further on 1145 f.)

1140. faenori: cf. on 532.

1142. tecum cauendumst‚ ‘I must be on my guard against you',

mutare) fidem cum, ‘to keep (and break) saith with’, Pseud. 376,
capere iudicem cum, ‘to go to law with’, Most. 557, Rud. 1380, 1382,
