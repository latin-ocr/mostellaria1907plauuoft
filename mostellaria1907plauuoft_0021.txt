in his Tamz'ng of the Shrew—narnes which do not occur in
the earlier play called The Iamz‘ng (gf a Shrew (A.D. 1594) on
which the play of Shakespeare is based—but also by the
general resemblance which the Tranio of Shakespeare bears
to the Tranio of Plautus. In both plays Tranio is the temptet
of his young master (T. eff Sh. I. 1, 1-47) whom he had
been specially charged to watch over by that master's father:—

F or so your father charged me at our parting ;
‘Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he;

Most. IV. 3 end, V. 1); so too the begging off of Tranio from
punishment (T. ofSh. V. 1, 132 f., Most. 1159 f.).¹

a made up story 3 his prototype‚ both in action and character,

author's mind is shown by Some direct quotations‚ e. g.
Act V, Scene 2 :

Nothing's more wretched than a guilty conscience:
cf. Most. 544:

nilzz‘l est miserius quam animus hominis conscius.

lee English Traveller by Thomas Heywood (1633) is
far more deeply indebted to the Mostellaria. Side by
side with the main plot there is a by-plot‚ occupying about
