80 MOSTELLARIA [144-149

144. decus, ‘ respectability '.

145. nimy-*nequior in usum, ‘ far less good for use ’3 correspond-
ing to nequior factus iamst usus aedium 113, where also nequior=
minus bonus. For in usum cf. 12 3 in usum boni ; for nimio cf. 011 72.

146. ita . . . putescunt, non uideor, ‘ these timbers are getting so
damp and rotten (cf. on 316), Ι do not think ', with parataxis instead of
a consecutive clause (ut uidear milzi); so Capt. 502 ff. ita me lassum
reddiderunt, uix miser iam eminebam3 Mil. 1047 ita me occursant
multae, meminisse haud possum; Pseud. 881-4 ita conuiuis cenam
conditam dabo . . . ip5us sibi faciam ut digitos praerodat suos3 Aul.
Prol. 9f.‚ Men. 94 f. Parataxis of an indicative is also found in
instances like censen despondebit? Rud. 1269, ⁶ do you think he will
betroth her?’ Aul. 309 (MSS), Capt. 9613 so Persius V. 168 censen
plorabit, Dave, relicta ?

147. non posse sarcire quin, ‘not to be able to patch (repair) . . .

so as to prevent ’.

totae perpetuae, ‘enti1·e, from top to bottom': cf. perpetuom
diem ‘the whole day' 765 3 Aen. VIII. 183 perpetui tergo bouis ‘the
whole chine of an ox’ (νώτοισι διηνεκέεσσι 11. VII. 321).

148. quom . . . perierint neo quisquam queat. These quom
clauses with the subjunctive (see on 29) look at first sight like causal
clauses, explaining non uidcor sarcire posse; but they are probably
better explained as temporal and as subordinate to quin . . . ruant.
It seems unnecessary‚ however, to explain the mood with Liibbert as
due merely to the subordination (‘ attractio modi‘) ; sor the subjunctives
have a clear meaning of their own, i. e. they express at least futurity;
‘when they shall have perished. . . and no one shall be able . . .';
perierint is equivalent in meaning to a fut. perf. indic.‚ with which
indeed it is identical in form, queat to a fut. indic. Such subjunctives
referring to the future ancl being little more than future-equivalents may
be called ‘prospective subjunctives’. [See further an article by the
present writer in the Classical Review for Feb. 1893, and W. G. Hale
‘The Antieipatory Subjunctive’, 1894. For Plautine instances with
pres. subj. see 249, 1064, Asin. 185 ut, quom uideat, gaudeat, Pseud.

same tenses adjusted to a past point of view, For quom clauses subor-
gllinate to q]uin see Aul. 791, Mil. 134² f., and cf. 'quin ubi in Aul. 613,

rue. 230.
