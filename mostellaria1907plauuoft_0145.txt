NOTES

THE acrostic arguments prefixed to nearly all the plays of Plautus are
certainly not by Plautus. himself; but their metrical construction is on
the whole so Plautine that they may naturally be supposed to belong to
an age not very remote from the time of Plautus-say a century after his
death.

1. manu mitto is an unplautine phrase3 Plautus always says manu
emittere (975)- or emittere manu.

amores, ‘ mistress ’ ; so Mil. 1377, Stich. 737, etc. : also in Cicero
and Ovid, peregrinos addis amores Her. ix. 47, cf. Verg. delicias domini
(παιδικά) Ecl. II. 2 ; in Pseud. 64 amores is used differently, --‘ loves’,
‘ toyings'.

5. emigratmn, sc. esse (impersonal passive construction).

6. lucripeta (from lucrum and peto, cf. lucri-'fuga Pseud. 1132, agri-
peta Cie.); to be joined as adjective with faenerator, cf. incola turba
Ov·. Fast. III. 582, bellator equus Verg. G. II. 145.

7. ludos fit, ‘is made game of ’‚ passive of ludos facere aliquem. In
this phrase ludos facere is equivalent to a compound verb gladi ari,
1067, 1147) and is therefore capable of taking another accusative;
cf. animum aduertere (animaduertere) aliquem or aliquid. In the
passive construction the accusative ludos remains: ludos fit aliquis, like
animaduertitur (=animum aduertitur) aliquis or aliquid, which is
found in Cicero (Div. II. 27, Fam. XI. 27. 7) and Varro (R. R. ΙΙ.
4. 4). So too in the accus. with infin. construction, which appears in
Pseud. 1 168 sese ludos fieri senserit and Bacch. 1090 me ludos bisfactum
esse, the accus. ludos is to be regarded not as predicated of the subject
but as an object retained in the passive construction. The older editors,
apparently regarding ludos in this phrase as predicated, changed it
in our passage into ludus (nom. sing), as though ludus fit senex were
parallel to consul fit aliquis. This schoolmaster's correction is
thoroughly unplautine3 early Latin knows no such phrase as ludum
(sing.) facere aliquem, and ludos f. a. means not ‘ to make someone into
games ' but ⁴ to make game of someone ’. Nor is ludos to be regarded
with Ritschl as an archaic form of the nom. sing.

mutuom, ‘ a loan ’‚ here absolutely (generally as adj. with argen-
tum), cf. Stich. 2 5 5 mutuom dare, Amph. 819 sumere mutuom.

8. acceptum, ‘ raised ‘.

dicit, ‘ the slave says ’ ε note the change os subject.
pignus, cf. 978, ‘ part-payment ’‚ ‘ earnest-money ¹, =arrabo 648,
1013.

9. requirit.. . ait . ..inspectat (10). The subject changes with

each of these verbs.
