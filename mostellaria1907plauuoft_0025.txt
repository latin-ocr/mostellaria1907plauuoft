INTRODUCTION xxi

some plays of Plautus and Terence resist any such division.
Apparently, then, an old Latin play consisted simply of

a succession of semes, and it is this that is reproduced in our
MSS. of both families.1

This play has suffered seriously by transposition of pages
in the archetype frorn which BCD are derived. The result
is that in these three MSS. a large part of the text is
dislocatedz² 802-841 are placed after 842-883: further,
601-646 follow after 884, 885 a, and 647-685 after 8852}-

1 The history of the five-act rule, which has played so important
a part in modern literature, is an interesting one. It seems to have
originated among the critics and perhaps also the playwrights of
Alexandria in the third century B.c.; see Ussing, Prolegomena to his
edition of Plautus, p. 165, and Leo, Forsclzungen, p. 207fl. Thence it
passed to Rome, where it was adopted asan essential element in the
theory of the drama in the first century Β. C. by Varro, and later on by
Horace, Ars Poetica, 189: —

Neue minor neu sit quinto productior actu
Fabula quae posci uolt et spectata reponi.

Varro applied the theory to the plays of Terence and perhaps also of
Plautus, dividing them into five acts: but there is nothing to show
that the theory was known at Rome before his time. In the early
empire we find the rule thoroughly established in the tragedies of
Seneca (also the Octavia), and it is probable that if we possessed the
Ajax of Augustus or the Thyestes of Varius or the Medea of Ovid we
should find that they too were divided into five acts. From Seneca the
practice passed to the scholars of the Renaissance and the Elizabethan
dramatists—a striking illustration of the influence of Hellenistic litera·
ture, through Rome, upon modern literary usage—though the men of
the Renaissance may also have been influenced by the precept of ἵ
Horace. The five-act rule was clearly not known to the Greek tragic
or comic poets of the fifth century B.C.: their dramas have no fixed
number of ‘acts '. Thus in Sophocles and Euripides we find that the
ἐπεισόδια together with the πρόλογος and ἔξοδος amount often to six and
sometimes to seven in number. Aristode, who speaks of the μέρη of
a tragedy, never mentions any fixed number of ἐπεισόδια.
² The palimpsest has escaped this error of transposition.
