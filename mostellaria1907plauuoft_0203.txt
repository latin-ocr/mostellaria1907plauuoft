632-654] NOTES N 117

632. uelim . . . ut, . . ., ‘I only wish that you would ask a single
sarthing more ’. This reference to the plus petitio is a thoroughly
Roman touch: if the plaintiff in an action demanded more than he had
a right to, he was liable to be cast in his suit (causa cadere, causam
perdere). Four kinds of plus petitio were recognized: (i) re, when the
plaintiff demanded too much, (ii) tempore, when he demanded payment
before it was due, (iii) loco when he demanded payment at a place where
the defendant was not bound to pay, (iv) causa, when he demanded
improperly in other respects. Cf. Cic. de Orat. Ι. 36. 167, pro Rose.
Com. 4. 10, Plaut. Poen. 732-738.

633. dicam dare: cf. on 17, 55.

635. ego iubeo, ⁴ Ι advise it’.

636. eo est argento factum, ‘ has been done with (become of) the
money ’ : for this abl. after facere aud fieri see on 222.

639. homo, ‘the boy '.

iam . . . uertitur (=the classical uersatur), ‘ is already taking to
business’.

640. ita erant ut dixi, i. e. haunted.

f643. u6ah, ‘ my goodness Ξ ’, ‘whew !'‚ an expression of admiration :
c . on 2 .

645. gpecujiolaras, ‘mirror·bright'‚ agreeing with aedis (acc.) in
642. Tranio here answers his own question (642), not that of Theoro-
pides (quid ita ?= quor non rogem ἒ).

candorem merum, in loose apposition to speculiclaras, unless
something has been lost in the text (see critical note).
646. quid, ‘ hark-ye'.
destinat. This verb means simply ‘to buy' in Plautus: cf. 974,
Rud. 4{'‚'Epsd.''487. The tense is usually taken to be present (‘ is he
the purchaser? ’) ; but see on perturbat 656.
647. talentum magnum, an Attie silver talent (again 9¹ 3) =

6: minam this is proved by octoginta minae 919 (2 >< 60 ε 1 20 — 40 = 80). ³

The Attic silver talent was probably called magnum to distinguish it
from other Greek and foreign talents of less value: cf. Rud. 778, 1344.

648. arra-honi (101 3= pignori, 978), dat. of the end sen-ed, ‘ as part
payment ’, ⁴ on account’. The word is prob. Phoenician (Heb.
‘ erabhon).

650. hinc=ab lzoc (danista) τ cf. on 547.

ei, sc. qui uendeklim for other vague uses of the pronoun cf. 628,
788, Ca t. 222.

Pseud. 615, Rud. 941 a, Trin. 871, 889, &c.

T mecum rem habe, ‘you may apply to me ’ z ef. Pers. 576,

ruc. 152.

654. Exit danista. Si eras fero, ‘if Ι get it to-morrow'. This use
of the pres, indic. with future reference (‘prospeetive pres. indic.’) is
common in old Latin, as in English: see 80, 539, with dum 99, 683,
688; cf. on 327, Rud. 179, 961. So sometimes even in classical Latin :
Sallust, Cat. LVIII 9 si uincimus (=uincemus)‚ Livy, VI. 15. 6, 38. 7.
