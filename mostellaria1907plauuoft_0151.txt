18-24] NOTES 65

name ; so ‘ Φίλιππος’ in Demosthenes, Ilion in Hor. Od. 111. 3. 18 ; the
repetition of Telephi in Hor. Od. Ι. 13. 1 f. expresses disgust: cf. the
entreating effect in Shakespeare, Taming of tlte Slcrew, Ι. 1 ‘ Tranio,
I burn, I pine, Ι perish, Tranio. 1 Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou
canst3 Ι Assist me, Tranio, for Ι know thou wilt ’.

19. augebis ruri numerum, genus ferratile, ‘you shall increase
(i.e. add one more to) the population in the rural districts—the gang
that works 'm irons'. Note the future of threat. Ruri is locative,
perhaps used adjectivally.to numerum. The phrase augere numerum,
ordinarily with the dative or genitive, denotes ⁴ to add to ‘‚ ‘ to increase
the sum or amount of ’ ; thus we have in Verg. Aen. VII. 211 numerum
diuorum altaribus auget, which means ‘ swells the roll of the altars of
the gods ' ; Lucr. 1. 436 corporis augebit numerum summamque sequetur
‘it will increase the amount of matter and join its sum-total ' 3 similarly,
with adj. instead of gen„ Ovid, Am. ΙΙΙ. 9. 66 auxisti numeros, culte
Tibulle, pios. But sometimes augere alone = ‘ to increase the sum of ’‚
as in Ovid, Met. ΙΙ. 264 exsistunt montes et sparsas Cycladas augent,
Plaut. Pers. 47 5 ciuitatem auxi ciui femina, ibid. 484. Hence genus
ferratile may be regarded as depending on augebis alone, though no
doubt it also forms a loose apposition to numerum. With the phrase
genus serralile cf. getius lenonium Pers. 582 ; ferratile = ferratus
Bacch. 781. For the sending of serui urbani into the country to work
at the mills see Pers. 21 f.

21. erilem probably goes with rem (1. 20); cf. rem erilem Men.
9663 the imperatives perde and corrumpe stand side by side without
a conjunction in the sense ‘destroy and ruin' (asyndeton). For the
connexion of rem and adul. cf. 28 corrumpat ec rem et filium, Trin.
114.

22. pergraecamini, ‘ play the Greek '‚ ‘ be as merry as a grig’ (the
English word grzg comes from Greek according to Palmer, Folk Etymo-
logy, p. 154 ; cf. the phrase ‘ a merry Greek ‘ which occurs frequently in
Elizabethan English, e. g. ‘Mathewe Merygreke' in Udall’s Roysler
Doyster and ‘ a woeful Cressid ‘mongst the merry Greeks ’‚ Shakespeare,
Troilus and Cressida, IV. 4. 58). For pergraecamini cs. the gloss in
Paul. F est. 215 epulis et potationibus inseruite. &Vc have the same
word again 64, 960, and in other plays. It expresses the contempt of
the Roman for the vices of the typieal Greek of later times: cf. Ben

Α Jonson, lee Fox, ΙΙΙ. 8:

Let’s die like Romans,

Since we have lived like Grecians.
In Horace (Sat. ΙΙ. 2, 11) graecari is ‘ to live a life of effeminate ease ’.
strictly, of course, the expression is impossible in the mouth of a Greek3
but it is not uncommon to find the persons of the comoedia palliata
talking like Romans: see Index (‘ Roman allusions ’). · .
