and the Miles Gloriosus), has nevertheless been often imitated.l
. An Italian translation by Geronimo Berrardo was produced
on the stage in 1501 3 and the following adaptations are based
wholly upon the plot of the Mostellaria, though the names of
the dramatis personae have been changed: I Fanlasmz‘ by
Ercole Bentivoglio (1545); Le Retour Impre‘vu by Jean
Francois Regnard (1700), which was the immediate source of
T he Intrzgruz·ng Chambermaid by Henry Fielding (acted at
Drury Lane, 1733 3 in this play the role of Tranio is assigned
to the scheming servant girl Lettice); Abracadabra by ‘the
Danish Plautus ⁹ Ludwig Holberg ( 1684-17 54 3 in this version
all the female characters are omitted). Besides these adapta-
tions there are a number of plays—enumerated in the following
paragraphs——which are partly based on the Mostellaria or
contain episodes or reminiscences from it.

That Shakespeare knew the play, either in the original or
in a translation,² is shown not only by his having taken from
Plautus the names Tranio and Grumio for two waiting-men

spiele (1886).

² There was no English translation of any of the plays of Plautus in
the sixteenth century except that of the Menaechmi by W. W. (probably
william Vt'arner), published in 1595, i. e. some ten years later than the
date of the Come-dy of Errors. It seems at least as likely that Shake-
speare read the Mostellaria in the original as that he was acquainted
with one of the Italian versions referred to above. The evidence that
Shakespeare knew Latin is growing stronger every year. Ι have
recently shown that Portia's great speech in the Merclzant of Venice,
IV. 1, 184—200, is based on Seneca’s De Clementia, of which there
was no English translation prior to that of Lodge, published in 1614,
i'. e. some twenty years after the probable date of the Alerclzant of
Venice (see my paper at the Congress of Arts and Science, St. Louis‚
U.S.A.‚ 1904, vol. iii, p. 189 f.‚ republished in the National Review for
June, 1906).—1 hope before long to publish evidence showing the in-
fluence of Plautus upon many plays of Shakespeare.
