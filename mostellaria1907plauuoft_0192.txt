106 ’ MOSTELLARIA [433-446

433. *pedem latum form together the object of inpos-isse, ‘to have
set one foot‘s breadth '.

ν 434. scies, ‘ you shall find out '.
inposisse (so MSS.) =inposiuisse (cf. 382) :inposuisse
hau causast . . . quin, ‘ 1 give you leave to': hau is a well
attested form of haud or haut, found also in the compound hauseio 783.

435. mihi, a dative often found with facere and fieri, cf. 776, Bacch.
360 quid mihi fiet .?, Cas. 117, Mil. 168, &c.; with futurum est Most.
231 (³), Truc. 633. Contrast the abl. in 222.

437. crediturus fui, ⁴ 1 was ever going to entrust ’.

440.> Aegypto =ex Aegypto, cf. Ponto ‘ from Pontus ’ Truc. 540
(where, however, it is preceded, according to a probable conjecture, by
ex Arabia in 539, and the effect of the ex may be carried on to Ponto) ;
these are the only instances of the bare abl. of the name of a country
denoting ‘ from ' in old Latin—a construction which becomes commoner
in silver Latin, especially in Tacitus. But we find in old Latin
constructions like Alide ‘in Elis ', Capt. 330, Alidem ‘ to Elis’‚ ib. 573.
Conversely names of towns are sometimes constructed with a preposition,
e.g. in Ephesum Mil. 113.

441. exspectatus, ‘ a welcome visitor '.

familiaribus, ‘the inmates of my house ’, including the slaves, as in
Mil. 183, 262, Asin. 743, Amph. 127, 146 &c.; sometimes the word
denotes the slaves excluding relatives, e.g. Men. 611, Amph. 359, &c.
44²· exspectatior3 the comparative of the participle exspectatus is
found only in this passage. Cicero has the superlative exspectatissimus
Fam. Χ. 5. 1, XVI. 9. 2, Att. IV. 4. Similar comparatives and super-
latives of perfect participles are common enough in Plautus, e. g. auctior
Capt. 782, confossior Bacch. 889, effertissumus Asin. 282, Capt. 775,
exclusissumus Men. 698, factius Trin. 397, z'npuratz'ssumus Rud. 751,
z'nsperatz'ssumus Poen. 1127, occlusz'or Trin. 222, porrectior Cas. 173,
propensior Bacch. 513, &c.

444. occlusa ianua. It was of course unusual to lock (occludere)
the house-door (ianua, fores cf. Truc. 2 54 f., Stich. 308) during the day3
but we need not infer that it was usual to leave it open: see a good
article by Martley in Hermathena IV. (1883), p. 303 ff.

interdius, ‘in broad daylight ’, an old adv, containing, acc. to
Biicheler. Lat. Decl. ξ 158, the gen. of dius (4th Decl. =dies); cf. Aul.
72, Asin. 599, Rud. Prol. 7, &c. we have dius opposed to noctu in Merc.
862 (noctu neque dius). The formation interdius is, then, precisely
parallel to internias ‘ on the way ’ Aul. 379, Poen. 1 162, &c. And just
as dius ‘ by day ' is agenitive, so probably is the adverb nox (=n0ctz’s)
‘ by night ', Greek νυκτός, German ‘ des Nachts ’.
445. pultabo. Here Theoropides gives the door a violent kick: cf.
aperitin (=aperitisne ε es. potin 396), ‘ will you open? ’‚ a common
Plautine formula: cf. 900, 988, Rud. 413, &c. For the use of the
present tense see on 261.
446. Here Tranio steps forward to greet Theoropides.
