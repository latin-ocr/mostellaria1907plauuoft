72 MOSTELLARIA [70-74

tibi actutum fore, ‘ will in no long time be applicable to your·
self.'

71. sic, ‘as it is ’, i. e. bene. ‘Meanwhile so long as things are as
they are', &c.; cf. sic armatus ‘armed as he was’, Livy ΙΙ. 10, 11;
sic nudos ‘naked as they are '‚ Cic. pro Rosc. Am. XXVI. 71.

istuc actutum, ‘your (threat of) “in no long time’'', cf. id
‘ actutum ' diu est Amph. 530, Most. 338 clz'u'st istuc ⁴ iam ' mihi, Proper-
tius II. 22. 14 ‘ quare' non habet ullus amor, ‘Love knows no “why” ἐ
istuc is like Greek τότ cf. Xen. Cyropaed. V. 1, 21 τό Ἐὰν μένητε,
ἀποδώσω, ‘the promise “ if you remain, I will repay' you '' '.

sino, ‘ 1 pass by ' = ‘ I don't mind ⁹.

72. itanest? lit. ‘so?' i.e. ‘really?' ‘is that your line? The
phrase expresses surprise or indignation: cf. Pers. 219 f., Rud. 971
Itane uero ? 747 Itane, impudens?

nimio z: multo ⁴ far ’, cf. 145, 442, 1103, Capt. 516 nimio mauelim,
Trin. 387 nimio citius, Pseud. 281 nimio id quod pudet facilius fertur
quam illud quod piget (a sentence of which the general run is very
similar to Most. 72 fi). Similarly nimis (nimium) is often scarcely
more than multum, e. g. 511 ; in 176 nimis stulta's is ‘ you are quite
too soolish‘: so 278, 947. The common phrase nimio plus or plus
nimio (Hom, Livy) is an instance of this idiom, and -= ‘ sar too much':
plus = ‘too much ’‚ nimio is an abl. of measure, not abl. of comparison
as it is stated to be by Orelli on Hor. Od. Ι. 18. 15, 33. 1, Epist. I.
10. 0.

733. quod molestumst, a periphrasis for ‘trouble ’, cf. Amph. 634,

and Publilius Syrus 507 quod timeas cilius quam quod speres euenit.

petas„ ‘ one desires (may desire) ‘ ; for the 2nd pers. sing. subj. with
an indefinite subject <‘any one and every one ', the ideal second person)
in a subordinate clause cf. 197, Epid. 718 sed ut acerbumst, pro bene-
factis quom mali messim metas (so Pers. 356); in a principal clause,
Most. 243 (note).

egipide, adverb of cognate meaning, cf. cupide cupis Cas. 267 and
on 31 . .

74. molestus ne sis nunciam, with reference to the molestum of 73,
‘don't be a trouble at this present moment‘, i. e. Ι will leave future
troubles to take care of themselves. The phrase ne moleslus sis occurs
five times in the Mostellaria (cf. 601, 771, 877, 886), and is a general
equivalent for the English ‘ shut up ’. This form of the prohibition (ne
with the present suly'mzctive) is common in old Latin, e. g. 468, though
in many passages it is doubtful whether we have a prohibition or a final
clause; see on 215. Other forms of prohibition found in Plautus and
Terence are ne with the perfect subjunctive or forms in -sis (e. g.
1097), ne with the imperative (e. g. 576, 643, 955 ηε molestu's, 1105),
caue with the present or perfect subjunctive (e. g. 810, 1025, 401, with
forms in ·sz's 523, 808), noli with the infinitive (e. g. 813).

nunciam (three syllables) is a more emphatic nunc, oecurring
frequently in Plaut., e. g. 1166, Trin. 3, Capt. 218, and probably derived
from nunc and iam, as quoniam from quom and iam, etiam from et
