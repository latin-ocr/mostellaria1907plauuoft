977. quid is? emit . . . ξ) ‘ Tell me, has he bought? ³ cf. Mil. 958

ne idem cantent (‘ tell the same tale ') quod priores, The whole truth
suddenly dawns on Theoropides.

patris amicu's. That Phaniscus does not recognize Theoropides
is explained by the fact that he has been absent three years (cf. 440) ;
Phaniscus is no doubt a new slave purchased during the interva13
so too Pinacium.

981. heu edepol, &c.‚ ‘ Alas! his father whom you speak of
is wretched indeed'. The combination lieu edepol (here supported
by A) is probably to be read in Asin. 292, Epid. 72, Men. 908, though
eu edepol is preferred by some editors: cf. lzeu hercle which is certainly
the right reading in Men. 731, Mil. 1056, Rud. 821, &c. Heu is exactly
opposite in meaning to eu: it is an ‘interiectio dolentis’‚ and occurs
, chiefly in phrases like heu me miserum, lieu misero milti. Contrast the
eu edepol of 241, &o

praedico, as Langen shows, does not here mean ‘ to call ’‚ but ⁴ to
speak of'3 lit. ‘you speak of his father as wretched'3 cf, Aul. 314

983. unus seruos sacerrumus, ‘ one particular rascal of a slave '.
Here unus is little more than aliquis or quidam ; cf. 1001, Epid. 453,
Stich. 153; with an adjective Capt. 482 dico unum ridiculum dictum,
Trnc. 2 51 sed est huic unus seruos uz‘olentissumus (a passage very
similar to the above). Loren2‚ however, takes unus as merely intensify-
ing the superlative, according to the well-known classical idiom, as in
Capt. 278, Asin. 521 unam mulierem audacissumam, Mil. 56 f. unum
inuictissumum.

istic: vaguely for illic3 cf. on 669, 913. >

984. uel Herculei conterere quaestum, ‘squander the gains of

dedit, sibi nouem apstulit, Stich. 233, 386, Ηοῐ. Sat. 11. 6, 12 diues
