104 M OSTELLARIA [402-416

licet, ‘all right ἔ ’ ‘ very good 2 ¹, cf. 930, 1153, and the locus
classicus for this use, Rud. 1212-1226. .

403. pultabit. Frank (‘ The Attraction of Mode in early Latin ')
notes that we might have expected a prospective subj. here instead of the
fut. indic. ; cf. 1095.

405. intus, ‘ from within ⁹.

hinc foris, ‘ frorn the outside here ’ (cf. 426 hinc ‘ from this side ’).

407—418. Philolaches’ appeal for protection in 406 amountS, in effect,
to calling Tranio his patronus (cf. 746 patrone, salue) ; and this suggests
to Tranio a reply of which, as it stands in the MSS., the general drift is
as follows: ‘ Neither patron nor client is of any use—to a man who is a
coward (like Philolaches). Toujours l‘audace J Now is the time for me
to show that Ι can rise to the occasion. Any fool can deal in crooked
ways at short notice; but it takes a man of ability to devise a scheme
which will not carry with it any unpleasant consequences‚ as Ι am deter-
mined to do on the present occasion ’. The words homini quoi nulla
in pectorest audacia are intended sor the ears of the audience only,
to whom Tranio turns to expound his plan of campaign. This explains
the change of metre in the middle of the sentence, for which we have
also a parallel in Amph. 1006. Philolaches and his party leave the
stage at 407. See critical note.

407. pluma haud interest, ‘there is not a feather's weight of differ-
ence ', i.e. there is no possibility of deciding : cf. the similar meaning of

followed by a double dependent question with the subjunctive.

possible notice ’.

facero nequiter, ‘ to deal crookedly ‘, i.e. ‘to hatch up some
scheme ‘ ; cf. malus and scelestus: ‘ sly ' (170, 1071, 1107).

412. uiri docti, ‘a man of genius ', cf. 186, 279, 1072, &c.

413. quae dissignata sint, ‘what has been boldly schemed ’ τ cf.
quid non ebrietas dissignat :⁹ Hor. Epist. Ι. 5. 16, modo quid dz'sszgnauit?
Ter. Ad. 87, where Donatus remarks ‘ Deszgnare (i.e. dissignare) est
rem nouam facere; in utramque partem et bonam et malam'. “
