162 MOSTELLARIA [802.-858

802. The lacuna in P may be filled with stultum haud esse (Kayser,
after Ritschl) or se apstinere (Leo).

803. The lacuna in P may be filled with odiose (Leo), or uerba ut.

804. Simo, added by Schoell.

810. Hiatus at change of speakers.

813. lzas supplied by Guyet.

816. After this line P have—

Vin qui perductet f> Apage istum pax-duetorem. non placet

Quid est Ρ errabo potius quam perductet quispiam,
which occur again in a different form after 844. Their presence herev
(after 816) has been ingeniously explained by Seyffert (Berliner Philo-
logische VVochenserift, 1887, p. 781> as due to some actor’s copy of the
play, in which lines 845 s. (apage istum ...perductet quispiam) were
entered in the margin after 816 as a substitute for lines 817-847, which,
however amusing, are not necessary to the action. The changed form
of the lines would be necessary in order to adapt them to their new
context. There are other indications of such shortenings of long scenes
for stage purposes in the MSS. of Plautus: e. g. Capt. 958 f. (as Seyffert
thought). Compare note above on 246.

832. ludificat Bentley, for LUDIFIGA'I'UR ΑΡ. UNACOR-
NIX A, cornix una P. DUOS A, duo P : so also in 834.

833. This line appears only in A, which has UIDEOR sor uideo
(before nam) ; corrected by Studemund.

842. Scan latius as a dactyl (which is unobjectionable in the first
foot .

8234. APUDFORUM A (cf. Asin. 329, Aul. 281, Cure. 474, Epid.
358, 422, Pseud. 896), ad forum P (cf. 999, Mil. 930, Pseud. 1236).

846. Here Ritschl introduced part of what the MSS. give after 816
(see crit. note). Hence the apparent omission of a line of the text.

851. modo supplied by Ritschl.

852. FETAQUAEUIS A, feta qua uis P.

853. Seyffert (Berl. Phil. Woch. 1889, p. 343) shows that in this
phrase eo ego is the regular order of words at the beginning of trochaic
lines, ego eo at the beginning of iambics. It seems then that in both
cases the verb is put in the rise of the foot, and the unemphatic pronoun
in the fall. But this rule does not apply to the compound abeo, which
is offered in this passage by A (EGOABEO), and which would also
scan (withfdrztm).

854. aliquis supplied by Ritschl, as suggested by Weise.

858-903. The F IFTH CANTICUM falls into two parts :—

(A) 858-884, solo of Phaniscus.
(B) 885-902„ duet of Pinacium and Phaniscus.

The metres are very miscellaneous; and it is difficult to see any clear
scheme of correspondence of the form to the thought. See Leo, Die
plautinisclzen Cantica und die hellenistiche Lyrik, p. 95. See Table 01
Metres.

The leaf of A containing 859-890 is lost.—Before 858 A has the
heading of a new scene (PKANISCUS, PINAOIU'M), which implies
