IN TRODUCTION xv

uncourageous country slave, Scapha, the would-be temptress
of Philematium, the merry Delphium, the pampered and
effeminate Phaniscus‚ the J'ealous Pinacium have all their
clearly marked traits, and stand out as living figures.
Perhaps the least effective character in the drama is the
prodigal son, Philolaches.

’ The management of the plot and humorous business
deserves all praise. But in criticizing the play as a whole,
it is impossible to conceal certain defects. We are not quite
clear about the ultimate fate of Tranio. But what about
Philematium? The thread of her destiny is completely lost.
Without attempting to prescribe a happy ending for the love-
story‚ such as that suggested by Lorenz¹, the reader notes
that Philematium, being the daughter of non-Athenian
parents, could not after manumission become the wife of her
liberator. The interest excited in the couple thus remains
unsatisfied„ Tranio has become so completely the hero that
Philematium and Philolaches are forgotten. But, as Professor
Bradley says in his Shakespearean Trager (1904, p. 70), how
many comedies are there in the world which end satisfactorily?
Sbakespeare has many improbabilities in the winding up of his
comedies; and the comedies of Aristophanes generally fall
off in interest and effectiveness at the end.

influence on modern literatures as some other plays of

¹ There might have been an ἀναγνώρισις, whereby Philematium might
have turned out to be the daughter of Athenian parents—a device osten
employed in the New Comedy.
