, panim istic captiost, ‘I am sure there is some trap there'; so
enim istaec captiost, Epid. 701 ε for this sense of captio see on 922 ; for

· emm on · 1.

1145. ἕὲἰά to Callidamates: i. e. if you want to take my place you

must first relieve me of my sear. Tranio thus refuses to abandon his
osition.
p 1146. Theoropides' is now ready to pardon his son (cf.1142); his one
desire' 1s to punish Tranio.
prae quam quibus modis. lit.‘ in compar-ison as how’. Prae
quam and prae ut mean lit. ‘in comparison as’ so in 982⁷ prae
quam altos dapsi'lts sumptusfaczt, lit.‘ in comparison as he mcurs’ ,&.,c
Mil. 20 nibal lzoc quidemst, prae ut alza dzcam, tu quae nuqu am secens
lit.‘ in comparison as Ι could tell of other things', i. e. ‘in comparison
with the other things I could tell of'. The prae quam or prae ut may,
however be followed by another subordinating conjunction or relative;
thus Aul. 507 sed hoc etiam pulchrumst prae quam sumptus ubi petunt,
‘in comparison as when, Men. 375 folla nunc cadunt, prae ut si
biduom hoc hic erimus, ‘in comparis son as if'; Amph. 633 satzn parua
rse est uoluptatum m mla, jv aequam quod molestumst,‘ in comparison
as what. '
quibus modis: cf. qms ex'emplts, 1040 and on 54. This and Cas.
944 are the only instances of the plural modis being joined with a pro-
nominal adjective: elsewhere we have quo (hoc, i,llo isto) modo.

1147 f. bene hercle facturn, &c.‚ i. e. ‘serve you right; you ought
to have had more sense than to be so taken in, at your age' . Note the
splendid audacity of Tranio in the rest os this scene.

qui sis: referring to te, understood in the principal clause.
1 149. si amicus, διο. Tranio impudently tells Theoropides to go to
the comic poets-they will put him into a play and pay him for the
idea of a new plot. Note that the author of the Greek original (the
Φάσμα) speaks of Diphilus and Philemon as his contemporaries. If the
Φάσμα was written by Philemon himself (see Intr. p. ix), he seems to
have introduced his own name here for the sake of the comic effect.
The passage also throws light on the date of the death of Diphilus,
which must have occurred some considerable time after Β. C. 289
(see on 775). We also see why Menander is not mentioned among the
contemporary comedians; he was no longer alive when the play was
written. [The dates of these writers of the New Comedy are probably
somewhat as follows 2-
Phssemon, born about 360, died 262 (98 years of age);
Diphilus, born between 355 and 350, died say about 280;
Menander, born 342, died 290.
