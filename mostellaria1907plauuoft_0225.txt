1010-1040] ¹ NOTES 137

1010 f. quod sciam, ‘to the best of my knowledge’, with subj. as in
classical Latin. The sentence is an interrogative statement (as distinct
from a question): ‘ You have, Ι believe, . . .'?’

1017. quod negoti: cf. on 904.

ut. . . gesserit? cf. Pers. 132 me ut quisquam norit? lit. ‘how
should any one know me?’=‘ to think of any one knowing me 2 ' Cic.
Cat. I. 9, 22 tu ut umquam te corrzgras? cf. too on 301 (iifi. Similarly
with pres. subj. 1172, Asin. 884 f.‚ Aul. 690, Bacch. 843, Cure. 616,
Pseud. 516, Rud. 10633 with imperf. subj. Mil. 962.

1018. negoti. The pronoun on which the genitive depends (aliquid)
is suppressed‚ as Simo interrupts himself, and turns his exclamation into
a uestion.

q1023. ne: final, ‘<1 say this) in order that. . . not ἐ cf. on 2 15, 613.

postules: cf. on ²59·

1025. hinc, ‘from this quarter’=‘srom us'3 cf. 596, 1039, and on
5 .

41026. 11110 me adspecta: cf. Amph. 750 age me lzuc adspice. Huc
is equivalent to ad me (cf. 689 where it=ad hunc), so that there is
a slight tautology. In the lacuna of twenty-one lines which occurs after
1026 e (see critical note) Theoropides no doubt arrived at a complete
understanding with Simo on all the points of the case. This is one of
the most important scenes in the play, and it is unfortunate that it
'should have been mutilated. The contents of the lacuna can, however,
be guessed from lines 1084-89.

1027. aiebat: sc. Tranio, whose name doubtless occurred in the
lacuna. The past imperfect tense of aio often represents the lacking
perfect, cf. 806, 1002 and Seyffert. Jahresbericht, 1386-9, p. 32.

1028. ideo: i. e. with a view to the marriage.

111οε adv.
aedificare in tuis ζ 50. aedibus) : i.e. to enlarge your house.
1030. uocis, &c., ‘ Ι am speechless '‚ ἀφασία μ’ ἔχει.

exturbauit corroborates turbauit (cf. racematus, exradzffcztus 1 1 1 1 f. ).

1033. indignis modis, ‘shamefullj‘3 for the plural see on 54.

1034. quid tu ais. ⁹ seems to express astonishment (‘ W hat do
1 hear ⁹ ') and 15 different from quzd ατς tu? in 615
