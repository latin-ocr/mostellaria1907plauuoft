108 MOsTELLAmA [471-493

471. nemo, ‘ (it is seven months since) any one' ε cf. Amph. 302 iam

diust quod uentri uictum non datis ‘ since you have given '.
tetulit. This is the predominating form of the perfect offero in
Plaut., and is occasionally found too in Ter., Lucr., Catull.

472. Circumspicedum, see on 120. Note that when a word has an
enclitic attached to it the two are accented as if they were one word ;
hence circmnspz'cedum, but primu‘mdum, ausculta‘dum. Thus the prose
accent coincides here with the metrical ictus (circumspicedum).

473. aucupet, sor aucupetur, cf. on 166.

probe: cf. on 4.

474. etiam, ‘ again ’.

475. capitalis, ‘atrocious'. caedis, an old form of caedes.

476. Note the pleonastic expression : iam diu, ‘ now for a long time ’,
antiquom, ‘ os ancient date’, et uetus, ‘and of old standing’3 but
Plautus often uses the combination antiquos et uetus (or uetus atque
antiquos) as an emphatic expression for ‘ old ’‚ like nuperus et nouicius
=‘ new', Capt. 718 ; see Bacch. 711, Amph. Prol. 118, Mil. 751, Pers.
53, Poen. 978, Trin. 381. The phrase is here (perhaps intentionally)
scarcely consistent with 480; but it agrees with abhinc sexaginta annis

9477. id adeo, ‘just that it is which ’‚ see on 280 : adeo lends emphasis
to id, asinv Amph. 952 is adeo, Aul. 291 ei adeo, 623 id adeo, 7395
similarly Mil. 1 192 ego adeo, Rud. 731 uos adeo, Pseud. 143 nunc
adeo. But possibly, as Sydow says, the adeo simply =‘ moreover’.

478. quid sceleris: cf. Ter. Eun. 326 quid hoc est sceleris& Epid.
350 quid istuc est uerbi ?

cedo: cf. 248.

482. hic ibidem, ‘ here in the same place ' ε cf. Capt. Prol. 26 ibidem
in Alide, Men. 379, Cist. 780 intus ibidem, Stich. 413 ibidem in cercuro,
in stega ; similarly una ibidem Trin. 203, 412.

ibidem here and often in Plautus ; but osten ibidem, e.g. Rud.
396, 847 z correct Lewis and Short.

484. ut foris cenauerat, ‘ having dined out, as he had’ : cf. on 268.

488. atque . . . derepente, ‘ when all of asudden ⁹: cf. 1127, Amph.
955, 1070, Verg. Ecl. VII. 7 atque ego Daphnin aspicio.

ille, vaguely, as Theoropides’question (489) shows. Tranio has not
quite made up his mind who shouted out, and refuses to commit himself
when asked.

489. st, the only Latin word which has no vowel in it; osten found in
Plautus and generally preceding tace or tacete. It generally counts as
a long syllable in the verse, but sometimes stands ‘extra versum ⁹, as in
506 (where it is doubled).

491. nempe ergo in 3., ‘ it was iu sleep then, if I understand you? ’,
i.e. it was only a dream aster all. For nempe in a question cs. 653, 919.

ita, ‘ es ’.

493. mii-um quin, with the subjunctive, ‘strange indeed that. . . not ',

is alffisir‘o‘nic‘ar (i.'e. it is equivalent to ‘ of course . . . not’‚ ‘ voudriez- .

vous que . . .?’): thus here, ‘ strange indeed that he should not have
