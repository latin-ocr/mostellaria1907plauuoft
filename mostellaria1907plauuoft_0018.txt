play concludes with the promise, extracted from TheoropideS,
that bygones shall be bygones.

The Mostellaria is one of the best of the plays of Plautus.
The characters are drawn with a masterly hand: Tranio is 7
almost an Iago in his ‘architectonic' faculty for intrigue; ¹
Philematium is one of the most charming figures in Plautus.
Her pretty simplicity of character and girlish delight in dress
are portrayed with effective naturalness‚ and her gratitude
and faithful devotion to her lover and benefactor Philolaches
raise her above her class. Simo too is a very well drawn
character. He belongs to a class often ridiculed in Plautus—
husbands of old, ugly and bad-tempered wives whom they
have married for the sake of their money. His discontent
shows itself in cynical sneers and a certain malignity of
temper. He is secretly amused by the misdeeds of Tranio
and Philolaches, of which he is fully cognizant; and he
even takes pleasure in the idea of keeping his neighbour
Theoropides in the dark about them. But when there is
a chance of see-ing Tranio flogged, he is quite ready to lend
his lorarz'z‘. He is totally without the capacity for sympathy,
and remains a mere outsider to the action. Theoropides is
the narrow-minded, mercantile Philistine, the chief notes
of whose character are avarice, superstition, and childish
vindictiveness. His only grievances are the pecuniary loss
he fears he may suffer, and the wounding of his amour propre.

reader is willing to condone his vices. The minor characters
are none of thern colourless. Grumio1, the honest but

of Tranio’s misdeeds is that it was nnnecessary to do so: Theoropides
gets the information otherwise (IV. 2).
