tzbi κατ’,ἅε ον ma'ma- }.dere

3² 1. No satisfactory emendation has been proposed. Lindsay suggests
moratu' s utz eb· ebibam but Delphium is not drunk‚ and ebzbere (⁴ drink
up ') would require an object.

326. Syllaba anceps ( przus) at diaeresis.

327. I have written accumlnmus (Leo concumbimus) for coimus P.
Concumbere is not used for reclining at table, and Plautus seems not to
use the verb' in any sense —For the prospective pres, indic. see on 654.

328. Sine sine may be scanned as a proceleusmatic, or as sm! szne,
which would make the line an iambic tetrameter. —smo. CA. scd ne
sme Hermann, sor sinos ἃ, (or ἃᾶ) Ρ.

33¹· mammam adero P: cf. 319.

356ρῖΓ Ῐεζ-νίίνῐὸαυεκ cf. flagritrz‘ba Pseud. 138, tympanotrz'ba Truc. 611,
ulmtriba Pers. 278. Compounds of τρίβειν have, in Greek, a short
penult. (from the verbal stem), e. g. πεδό-τριψ (-τρῒβ-). But Plautus
forms his hybrids in -lrz‘b- direct from the present stem (-τρΐβ-).

rum P. falas Camerarius, for falsa P,

358 has not yet been satisfactorily emended. Is it possibly an
interpolation ἶ)

562. sumne Pylades, for sumne ille P. The ille has probably arisen
by dittography (Seyffert, Jahresbericht‚ 1883-85, p. 58); even if it can
be scanned, it is never found in Plautus with the predicated adjective in
sentences of this kind: Bacch. 91, Men. 852, Merc. 588, Pers. 75.
Pseud. 908, Rud. 1184.
