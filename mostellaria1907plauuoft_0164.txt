78 MOSTELLARIA [124-132

reparoumt, ‘ grudge ’, with dat„ as in Truc. 376 reparcis sauiis;
contrast the accus. with parcere in 104.

125. neo sumptus ibi sumptui, &c., ‘and think no expenses too
expensive in that case’3 lit. ‘ think expenses not an expense’ (predicated
dat. .

138. nituntur, ‘ it is their ambition ⁹.

ut expetant sibi esse, ‘to be bent on having’3 ci. 103. For the
plethora os words cf. on 89.

similis (accuS. plur.) illorum, ‘children like those ⁹.

1 ²9· The word adminiclum (=adminiculum) is chosen with special
reference to the lzouse : ‘ a prop ', ‘a stay '.

danunt, is an old Latin word meaning dant 3 no other form of this
verb is extant: cf. 561.

130. tum iam, ‘ then immediately ’, cf. lzz'c iam 107.

131. Generally interpreted ‘ so sar (only) are they (i.e. the children,
with change of subject) removed from the care of the builders ’, i. e. to
the extent of entering the army under the charge of some relative, as
Ascanius is entmsted to Epytides, Aen. v. But it must be admitted
that this is very strange Latin. Possibly it is intended to mean ‘ to this
extent they (the parents) behave differently from builders ', i. e. there is
nothing to correspond to this in the case of house-building. But see
textual note.

132. igitur tum=⁷6re δή or δὴ τότε (Homer), cf. 689, {gitur . . .
tum Capt. 871, tum zgitur Trin. 676. Igitur was originally an adverb
of time, denoting ‘then ⁹ (the precise derivation is uncertain): it was-
therefore synonymous with tum. Thus we find in the Laws of the XII
Tables si in ius uocat, ito ‚· nz' it, antestamino‚· tgrz‘tur em (=eum)-
capito ‘ is A summonses B, let B go ; if he refuses, let A call a witness to·
the fact; then (igitur) let him seize B’; and Festus, p. 105 M.‚ says⁴
‘ agitur apud antiquos ponebatur pro inde et postea et tum '. Like the
English ‘ then '‚ it frequently marks the entrance of the apodosis‚ corre--
sponding to an ubi or quando or si in the subordinate clause ς so Mil.
772 quando habebo, {gitur rationem mearum fabricarum dabo, Lacr. ΙΙ,
677 (cf. note of Munro on 1. 419). Where it is combined with tum it
simply strengthens it ε ‘ at that very moment '. [For egitur demum =
tum dseritum see on 3805 for igitur in protasis, on 393; for ergo agitur,
on 8 .

Ἑρεοίωθη oei-nitur, lit. ‘a sample is sifted off ’; the meaning of
the phrase comes out more clearly in Bacch. 399, Cas. 516 nunc
specimen specitur, nunc certamen cernitur ‘now a sample is seen,
now the question at issue is decided’, whence we get the abbreviated
specimen cernitur ‘ a sample is put to the proof’. Compare the use of
⁴ proof ' in English, as applied to a sample of printing.

quo eueniat, ⁴ as to how the building is to turn out'. The sub-
junctive is an injunctive, i. e. it has the independent meaning of ‘ shall ⁹,
‘is to ’, though it stands in a dependent question ; cf. on 89 ὸς so Mil.
1097 quid me consultas, quid agas ? (⁶ what yon are to do ’)‚ &c-
Henee the reference to the future; cf. Verg. Georg. Ι. 29 where uenias:
