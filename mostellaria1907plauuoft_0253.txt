858-947] CRITICAL NOTES 163

that that MS. recognized no new scene at 885. I have followed its
indications.

860. I have restored the end of this line as a Reizian colon by adding
pro· on the basis of the adaptation of the passage which is given by the
MSS. in Men. 983 f.

862. I have omitted the pronoun before sz' (sed hii si P) as out of
place and spoiling the scansion.

873. So Bergk, for Bonis (·ni) sum improbis (-bi) sunt malus
fuit.

87 6. uocitantur Hermann, for uocantur P.

879. inde apstuli: abz‘z' Bothe (after Camerarius), sor unde abstul-
tabi P. See explanatory note.

880. ego added by Studemund : to be scanned without elision of ere.

881. To be scanned without elision of quom.

882. Scan eos as forming the resolved rise of the third foot (at end of
the trochaic dimeter catalectic)‚ though, as Skutsch says, this is not
unobjectionable.

885 b. respicis D, respiees C, respice B.

886 a. sies Hermann, for sis P.

887. Ι have transposed <after Spengel) impure parasite P.

888. poteris Camerarius, for potores P ; Leo potis es.

889 occurs after 886 b in P; transposed by Acidalius.

’ 890. I have written facis te, quia ted erus for facis quia te
eratus P. Ferocem facis without the reflexive pronoun is hardly Latin.

899. his qui Guyet, for qui 1118 P <and A Ρ).

904. lzoc esse supplied by Ritschl.

905. nusquam Schoell, for numquam P,. ‚QUAM A

912. sz· supplied by Camerarius.

914. accipiem and cupies P, corrected by Camerarius.

922. My emendation captionis, for captioni P, had been anticipated
ἵῖξῗξζξῗέἓιῗῗῖἓ 132, ,Sminquam PA')(with which quia P, is hardly in-
ei e· caue ever....

9561. I have written ΤΛ). eam mz habeas for eam dehis P, ,AMBIS (?)
A; several other reading s giving the same sense might be suggested
(e. g. meam habe). Before eam there is a space in B for a change of
speakers, without which there is no point in 927 (aps te modo un0): see
explanatlory note. —B2 corrects dehis to debes; but debere gratiam
is not P autine.
