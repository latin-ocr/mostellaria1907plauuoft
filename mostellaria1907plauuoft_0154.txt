68 MOSTELLARIA [40-48

gated filth’), cf. Shakespeare, Kz'ng Lear, IV. 2 ‘ Proper deformity
seems not in the fiend So horrid as in woman '.

rusticum nom. for voc„ as in Stich. 764, Poen. 366 f.‚ &c.

hara suis, ‘ you pigsty '.

41. canem capra commixtam, ‘ bitch compounded with she-goat ⁹.
If the MS. reading is correct, the accus, must depend as a second
cognate object on oboluisti, from which it is separated by the vocatives
ofl. 40. Note the alliteration c. c. c. and cf. 55, 201, 311 f., 986, 1065,
1114 and note on 32.

quid uis fieri? ‘que voulez-vous3‘ ‘ what would you have?'
The phrase occurs also in Aul. 741, Amph. 702.

42. olere. Plautus uses sometimes ole⁹re‚ sometimes olore, as in next
line: in 268 we have the pres, subj. olant, cf. 278, Poen. 268, Mil. 41 ;
in Most. 273, 277 the pres. indic. olent: cf. note on 836.

43. superior (predicated adjective) accumbere, ‘to sit at table in
a place of higher honour', cf. Stich. 696, Hor. Sat. II. 8. 20-3. But
the singular superior is a difficulty. Is the text is sound, quiuis potest
must be understood ont of omnes possunt. See critical note.

quam erus, i. e. than Philolaches (the erus minor).

45. facetis uictibus, ‘dainty dishes’, Qhoice meats '. For uz'ctz‘bus
cf. Mil. 7 39 ; in Bacch. 1 181 we have it opposed to uino and unguentis:
cf. Most. 730. If there is no lacuna after 1. 43 (see crit. note), it seems
simplest to supply an infinitive (πέπωκ’-τ( to live on ¹, ‘ to eat ') out of
accumbere (‘ to sit at table ' implies eating). Schoell suggests that
uictibus may depend on accumbere, like epulis accumbere; but then
quam tu uiuis is difficult.

48. aleato (so P) or aliato, from oleatum or aliatum, a noun which
does not occur elsewhere but which apparently means, ‘food seasoned
with garlic '; the abl. is an abl. of means: ‘let me fulfil my destiny
on food seasoned with garlic'. Aleatum is no doubt to be regarded as
a substantival use of an adjective aleatus, -α, ·um‚ formed from alium,
⁴ garlic' (l. 39), like unguentatus from unguentum, palz'bulatus (56)
from patibulum, palliatus from pallium, διο. Note that these adjectives
in ·tus correspond to English adJ'ectives in -ed formed from nouns, e. g.
barbatus ‘ bearded ‘, dentatus ‘toothed ’, auritus ‘ eared ’, &c. Aleatum
then=cibus aleotus, lit. ‘ garlie'd food'. Perhaps, however, the emen-
dation of Saracenas aliatum (the accus. of this adj. agreeing with me, =
⁸ fed on garlic ’, ‘ smelling of garlic ') yields a better sense.—Garlic was
a favourite ingredient in the food of the poorer classes at Rome (cf. on
22), especially in the dish called moretum3 cf. the use of asafoetida
(lasserpz'cium, Rud. 630, Pseud. 816).

fortunas fungi. Fungi always takes the accuS. in old Latin
(except perhaps in Ter. Ad. 603) : cf. Trin. 1 ut munus fungaris tuom;
see Langen in Wolfflin’s Archiv III. 329 f. on the constr. of utor,
fruor, fungor, potior in O.L. Fortunae (pl.) in Plautus never has the
sense of ‘riches', ‘ possessions ', so common in Cic., but always that of
‘ fate ', ‘ destiny ’ : cf. Mil. 1 25 conqueritur mulier mecum fortunas suas,
Rud. 523 o scirpe, scirpe, laudo fortunas tuas, διε.
