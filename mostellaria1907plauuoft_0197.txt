515-532] NOTES 111

1110 person behind the door and at the same time sounds to Theoropides
like an appeal to the ghost.

517. segreges sermonem, ‘break off the conversation ’, cf. Mil. 655,
Poen. 3 .

519. lazicum, interrogative : cf. on 174, and Mil. 424 f.

an . . . appellaueras P, ‘ Was it you that called?' For the tense
cf. on 821. Tranio now pereeives that Theoropides has not heard the
words spoken from within (515).

520. amabunt, ‘ shall love ’, almost an expression of wish ; cf. Amph.
563, Men. 278, Pers. 16.

522. sed tu, etiamne. A question addressed to a new person, or
to the same person as before but on a new subject, is frequently pre-
faced by sed tu in Plautus, to attract the attention of the person
addressed (‘ but, I say ')‚ e.g. Bacch. 195, 420 f., Men. 648, Most. 1135,
Rud. 365, 987 ς and on this analogy may be explained the sed ego, sumne
in Most. 362, where Tranio addresses himself. etiam, ‘still', so 8513
etiam uzssgilas .? 383 15 quite different.

quae dieo: the omission of the antecedent is a characteristic
Plautine idiom; cf. Mil. 692-694 (1111100), 1077, Capt. 941, Rud. 624,
1322, Amph. Prol. 38 and 449 non ego illi obtempero quod loquitur, &C.
523. respexis, curassis (526), cf. on 68, 212.
, 524. pax mihist oum, ‘ I have made my peace with '.
525. seio, ‘ so you said before '‚ half ironically; cf. Aul. 434.
extimuerae: for the tense cf. 519 and on 821.
526. 1111 . . . cua-assis, see on 212.
prouidero is here hardly different from prouidebo, cf. 590, 687,
921, 1007 (cenauero), 1103, 1143, 1152, 1174, Rud. 330, Capt. 315 bene
merenti bene profuerit, male merenti par erit. Contrast 211, 240, 689,
1007 (uocauerit).

527. quis from queo,

528. Herculem, i. e. as Ἀλεξίκακος. With the invocation to Hercules,
exit Theoropides. Tranio curses him as he goes, and then, reflecting
on his handiwork‚ stands aghast at his own audacity.

529. et=‘ and . . . too ’ς trans. ‘and so do I': so in 397, 426.

., 532. Enter the money-lender from the direction of the forum (town),
i. e. by the stage-door to the right of the spectators. As some little time
is supposed to elapse before his entrance he does not see the departing
Themopides, who perhaps leaves the stage by the same door (right ;
unless we are to infer that he met the vendor of the house at the harbour,
cf. 547). The money-lender does not see Tranio till 560.

scelestiorem, ‘ unlucky ' ε cf. 504, 563.

argento faenori, ‘for money (put out) at interest ’, =argcntaffl
faenb'rz' c'b'lldcando. That this is the meaning is shown by 535. But it is
difficult to quote an exact parallel, whether faenori is a dative of the end
served, as generally assumed, or a locative. The nearest thing to this
adjectival use are such phrases as sagnam receptui Cic. Phil. XIII. 7.
15, satui semen Cato, R. R. 5, iudices domi duellique duellatores Capt.
Prol. 683 but the gerundive is usually added, as in triumuir coloniis
