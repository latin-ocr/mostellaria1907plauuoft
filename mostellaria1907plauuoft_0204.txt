118 MOSTELLARIA [654-661

lV. 42. 6, Cic. ad Att. X. 3 dum cognosco (ecognoscam)‚ and often with
antequam, e. g. Cat. IV 20 antequam redeo, Verg. Aen. 111. 606 si pereo
(- peribo) This idiom must be carefully distinguished from cases in
which the if· clause refers to present time and the principal clause to
future time, e. g. Hor. Epist. Ι. 7. 32 sc· κίε( if you now wish ') effugere
i'‚st2nc macra cavum repetes (‘y ou will go back’ Note that the
prospective present9 denotes‘ shall’ rather than ‘will' ; 50 100 1110
present in quid ago? (368). Contrast the use denoting resolve, 261.

655. quod puts the curse in relation to the last speaker’s remark,
‘wherein may all the gods confound you!’ : cf. Amph. 563, Pseud. 1130.
Lorenz and Ussing say quod=ali3quod Dziatzko, on T.er Phorm. 976
(a line borrowed from our passage), takes malum as an independent
imprecation and the antecedent of quod.

656. ita: cf. on 56.

perturbat. It is probable that Plautus used a contracted form of
the perf. of the 1st conj. in· -αί 01 -aut (for- -aui;t) this suits here very
well, and not only on the ground of the 501150. for (1) Plautus uses
paene or paenzssume in eighteen other passages with the perfect tense
(like Most. 453, 456), and never with the present except in the following
passages where it qualifies the predicated adj. or adv. with sum—capt.
Prol. 61, Pers. 114, Rud. 1204, Stich. 216; (2) if the form is perturbdt
it would have a secondary accent on the first syllable ( pel} turbat) and
an accented syllable 15 desirable in this place of the verse (see below).
F or perturbat cf. dz‘csturbrt Lucr. VI. 587 (MSS.) and notes of Munro
ed. by Dufl' on Ι. 70, 111. 1042, Υ. 396; Ρο15. 834 (R), Asin. 501, Cas.
543, Mil. 1038, Trin. 169, 601. [The above law of accentuation is stated
as follows by the present writer in Class. Rev. Vol. XX. No. 3, p. 156: The
third rise (i. e. arsis) of the iambic trimeter, and the fifth of the trochaic
septenarius, is normally introduced by a syllable bearing or capable of
bearing a word· accent, either principal or secondary, in prose3 and if
the accent fails here, this defect 111 1110 accentual rhythm is either
compensated by a word· accent at the next rise but one or else there is
synaloepha of the offending word. Cf. Most. 26, 440, 453, 6883 263,
959 ]paenissume, a humorous superlative of paene, also in Aul. 466,
668: cf. pectore penitissumo Cist. 63 from penitus; z'psissumus Trin.
988, and the comparative in Poen. 991 nullust med hodie Poenus
Poenior.

657. 11οῶ0, ‘non tempus significat, sed iracundam eloquentiam ac
stomachum', Donatus on Ter. Ad. 215³ cf. 1067, 1073, Amph. 398,
1 Men. 217, Rud. 177 (‘this blessed day‘), &c.; Hor. Sat. ΙΙ. 7. 21.

ἱ 658. minus bono cum iure, ‘more unreasonable’.

660.οοοο autem, again 6765 somewhat like sed ecce 496, but here
without any adversative meaning, ‘behold now' : cf. Merc. 748 and note
of Lorenz on Pseud. 305 credere autem? (‘ believe, quotha? ⁹.)

diciano, see on 261 (instances with the 2nd person).

661. nomen quaero quid siet: for the ‘anticipation' cf. 254. 111
