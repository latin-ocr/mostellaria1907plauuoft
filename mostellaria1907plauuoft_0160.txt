'74 MOSTELLARIA [εδ-89

Rud. 309, &c. Compare Ital. ‘eccon—Granum does not wish to speak
to the prodigal son, but leaves the stage (right) in sorrow and anger.

Ι. 2 (lines 85-156) : FIRST CANTICUM. Enter Philolaches, the pro-
digal son, from the house of Theoropides. His morning reflections
turn on the havoc which he has made of his life by a career of dis-
sipation. He reproaches himself ζ 149 ff), without however forming
any good resolutioris for the future3 and his short-lived repentance
is scattered to the winds by the first sight of Philematium in the next
scene. The present monody contains a comparison osa young man to
a newly built house—a simile which is worked out in detail with great
ingenuity. It falls logically into the following parts, which correspond
to its metrical structure (see critical note) :—-

Part I: 85—119. 'I'he simile of the house.

Section A : 85-104 (bacchiac rhythm). Introductory passage con-
taining the enunciation of the simile, and description of the
building of a house.

Section B: 105-119 (cretic rhythm). The house under a bad
master and exposed to wind and rain.

Part 11 : 120-156. Application of the simile.

Section A: 120-132 (bacchiac rhythm). The upbringing of a

oun man.

Sectign Bg: 133—156 <cretic rhythm). The young man left to his
own control (a bad master) and exposed to idleness (the wind)
and love (the rain). sels-reproaches and despair.

Note that the cretic metre in both the sections in which it is used
expresses a gloomy mood; so too in Cas. 621-8 milla sum, milla
sum, lo'ta tota decidi, &c.; Rud. 664-7 3 ς Most. 690-733 is in the main
of a melancholy tenor. But this is not true of all cretic cantica.

8 5—104. Subject: Introductory passage and enunciation of the simile.

85. Recordatus, ‘ cudgelling my brains ‘, ‘ pondering ⁹, not ‘remem-
bering’: cf. Ovid‚ Her. x. 79 non tantum quae sum passura recordor
(‘think over '). Recordatus has here the force of a present participle
(= cogitans, reputans), as osten in deponent verbs (e. g. ratus, lapsus).

Join multum et diu, ‘ deeply and long have I reflected '.

86. argumenta, ‘proofs', ‘evidence '‚ cs. Truc. 169 AST. Amator
similis oppidist hostilis. Dm. Quo argumento ?; Rud. 1023, Asin. 30² ;
sor the plur. cf. 92, 99, 118, Rud. 1180 argumentis exquirere, Amph.
