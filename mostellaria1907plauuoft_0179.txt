256-261] NOTES 93

in Most. 457, 890 it is ratheran expression of horror or pain, cf. too 643.
In Trin. 1137 it is colourless.

quid . . . quicquam, ‘ what thing at all 't sor the pleonasm cf.
Aah 810 ‘quis me Athenis nunc magis quisquamst homo quoi dz· sint

o ‘tz'i ?
prptpooe (shorter form of potis) without the verb esse often=‘to be
>able ’; thus here pote :pot-est, Trin. 352 pote = potes ; so Verg. Aen. III.
671, where potis :potis est.

257. dudum, ‘just now '; cf. Rud. 1079, 1123. So πάλαι sometimes,

258. qm'd . . . nam=quidnam. Nam is frequently separated by one
or more words from the interrogative in Plautus (e. g. Aul. 136, 427,
Bacch. 1114, Rud. 945), and sometimes it appears right at the end of
the sentence, e. g. 368, Capt. 799 quae' illaec emz'ndtiost nam ? Bacch.
1 12 1 quidhoc est nego'tz' nam, ama'bo? For the phrase quid opus Ρ ‘what
need?’ see Rud. 118 (so the MSS.); with est Most. 287, 309, 993.
Compare siquid opus est Rud. 124, quod opust 1224, nil opust Most.

white-lead ; melinum 264 (so called because it was got from the island
'of Melos)=pipe-clay ; atramentum 2 59=ivory black or lamp-black;
purpurissum 261, a* red paint answering the purpose of rouge. Painting
the face aud eyebrows was a common practice among Greek women3
but this scene must have raised a laugh from the audience.

259. una opera, ‘just as well ’ ; cf. Men. 794 and on Capt. 563; for
a different sense cf. Men. 52 5 (‘ at the same time ’). Similarly eadem
o era 10 .

p posi’gleffi ‘you might expect’3 for this meaning of postulare cf.
1023, Trin. 2 37, Capt. 739 cur ego me esse saluom postulem? For the
‘ potential ' meaning see on uideas 243·

260. euge = Greek εἶνγε ; cf. 586, 686, and note the change of quantity.
It is exactly equivalent in meaning to eu 241.

261. non do, ‘ 1 won’t give (it) ' ; cf. Ter. Phorm. 669 nil do, ‘ 1 won't
give anything '‚ and the English ‘ I go’=I will ἕο, ‘ Do you start to-
morrow?’ &c. The use of the present indicative expressing resolve
(1st‚ 2nd and 3rd person) is a common conversational idiom in Plautus
and Terence, though generally ignored by commentators. In this play
we have: rst person, clamo, ‘1 will shout’ 577, eo 853, non eo 877:
2nd person, etiam uigilas? ‘will you wake up? ’ 383, dz'cisne?‘66o,
abin :⁹ and abin hinc? 850, etiam respicis? 885, manesne? 887, etiam
aperis? 937 f. ; 3rd person, non dat, ⁴ he won’t give ⁹ 595, nemo dat 601,
dat 1089, ecquis aperit? 445, 900, 988. [For instances in 'other plays
see the editor’s notes on Rud. 1040, 781, 413, and add Bacch. 592,
Cure. 41, 311 f.‚ 621, 662, 712 f., Trin. 1059, Ter. Eun. 493 f., Haut.
611, Phorm. 485, 8935 cf. Martial X. 25. 6 non facio. Most instances
of quin with the pres. indic. in questions seem to belong to this use (see
on 343), and the pres. infin.=fut. infin. (see on 17) may be traced to it.
On the other hand, the pres. indie. has its ordinary meaning in instances
like etiam astas? Men. 697; and the use in subordinate clauses with
