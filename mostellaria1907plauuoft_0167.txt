708, 901 b, Capt. 228 ero ut me uoles esse, ibid. 307, 120 non uidere ita
(=talis) tu quidem, Amph. 575, Trin. 46 si ita's ut ego te uolo.
Dependent questions and dependent exclamatione commonly
take the indicative in old Latin (parataxis, the question-clause or
exclamation-clause being in form co-ordinate with the principal clause) ε
so 572, 614, 626, 104o; exclamatory, 460, 1172. But the subjunctive
is also found in Plautus, and not only where it has independent meaning
but also in other cases, e.g. 199 and 969, where indic. and subj. stand
side by side without any clear logical distinction. The subjunctive is
more usual when the subject of the question-clause is ‘ anticipated ‘‚ as
in the second half of 969.—-XVe have, then, in Plautus the beginnings of
a construction which became greatly extended in later times ; in Terence
it is commonet than in Plautus, and it became almost universal in the
classical period <the exceptions being then mostly in cases where the
subordinate clause has an exclamatory character, e. g. Verg. Ecl. IV. 52

150. 9Phe general sense of this and the next (lost) line must have
been z ‘ no one of all the youth was either more energetic or took greater
pleasure in athletics ’. So 151 f. ‘ my indulgences were gymnastics‚’ &c.

industrior. The form is ante-classical ; cf. crit. note on 407.

'1 54. discipulina (so the MSS. in this passage), from discipulus, recurs
in Asin. 201. But the form most commonly used by Plautus is disci-
plina (e. g. Cas. 657), which is parallel to popli, &c. ; see note on 15.
The word here = ‘ rule ', ‘ pattem ’‚ cf. Asin. 201 eadem nos discipulina
utimur, Mil. 187, Pseud. 1664, and Cic. in Cat. Ι. 5, 12 quoniam id,
qu'qg'l maiorgem-disczplinae (‘ rule of our ancestors ’) proprium est, facere
no um au o.

155. optumi quique, ‘all the best young men’, as a class. The
singular optumus quisque would be practically synonymouS, but it would
refer to individuals. In the classical age the plural usage is for the most
part limited to the neuter (optima quaeque, antiquissima quaeque, &c ;
Madvig, Gram. ξ 495), but other genders appear occasionally: Cicero
de Amic. X. 34 in optimis quibusque, de Off. II. 21. 75 proxumae
quaeque, Epist. ad Fam. V11. 33. 2 litteras longissimas quasque; Livy
Ι. 9. 8 proxumi quique, repeated by Tacitus, Agr. 36.

156. nunc postquam sum, ‘now that Ι am’, so Bacch. 531 nunc
ego illam me uelim Ι C onuenire, postquam inanis sum, ‘ now that I am
penniless ’. Here sum refers to present time only. In other instances
the force of the present after postquam is different; thus Most. 92 5 tibi
numquam quidquam, postquam tuos sum, uerborum dedi, ‘ever since
Ι have been your slave’, Men. 234 bic annus sextust, postquam ei rei
operam damus, ‘ since we lzave been engaged on this business‘ (=sextum
iam annum damus). Thirdly the present is often historica, e. g. (with
a present tense in the principal clause) Capt. 487, Cure. 683, Mil. 124,
(with perfect in principal clause) Men. Prol. ²4· The same tense and
ugabgaecaregalfi'o 1common after ubi and quom; see Most. 1051, Amph.
