148 MOSTELLARIA [εν-ιη

f 57. A degactive line in P : carnufices supplied by Leo ; huc si Guyet,
or si huo .
62 f. So I propose to correct the corrupt reading of P :—
(S)eruom daturi estis bubus quod feram
Data. es in(h>onestis &c.
See explanatory note. It would also be possible to read ni for si in
62, and in 63 Date aes ,· si non est, &c.
66. Scan abt rus (not abi ru's as in l. 8), for the sake of the caesura;

this alsofblrlings the emphatic ego into the rise of the 3rd foot, instead of
into 1 s a .

72. [tanest ? Seyffert, sor Ita est P.

7 3. Venit quod molestumst Bentley, for Venire quod moleste P.
84. Scan with hiatus at caesura.

85-156. The FIRST CANTICUM falls metrically into two main parts

of nearly equal length, each of which consists of two sections, Α
bacchiac, B cretic. Thus :-—

Part 1: 85-119 (31 lines).
Section A ε 85—104 (16 lines), with predominating bacchiac rhythm.
Section B: 105-1 19 (15 lines), with predominating cretic rhythm.
Part ΙΙ : 120-156 (32 lines).
Section A : 1 20-132 (10 lines), with predominatingbacchiacrhythm.
Section B : 133-156 (23 lines), with predominating cretic rhythm.
The end of each section, however, breaks away from its predominating
rhythm into iambics or trochaics‚ which form a kind of flourish at the
end, indicating a transition to a new metre. With each change of mette
and music the actor and the tibicen who accompanied him seem to
have crossed the stage; ef. Cic. pro Mur. 12. 26 transit idem iuris
consultus tibicinis Latini modo.
86. After this line the MSS. have two tautologous and probably
spurious lines :— '

Eam rlem uolutaui et diu disputaui.

9²· Quando hio P, but lzic is meaningless—ei rei: both words are
monosyllabic (see Seyffert in Studia Plaut. p. 2 5).
After this line the MSS. have two probably spurious lines :—
Atque hoc haud uidetur ueri simile uobis?
At ego id faciam esse ita ut credatis.
98. Scan mea haud dli· as standing for a proceleusmatic (ὺυφυ.)
104 similes ut sient or similis uolt (or uolunt) suas are uncertain

1 rg 2. Ι have ventured to retain the MS. reading putrefacit, though it
is given up by all editors since Ritschl in favour of pateffacit, a compound
coined by Ritschl and intended to be synonymous with putrcsacit. But

the {fausion of putrefacit is uncertain—perdit Bergk (cf. 136), for
