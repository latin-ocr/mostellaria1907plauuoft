241-253] NOTES 91

Note argentum = ‘money’ French argent· —a meaning common in
Plautus, and found in the Satires and Epistles of Horace and 111 Juvenal,
but not in classical prose.

241 f. Note the n'me assem, -assem (perhaps unintentioual).

243. uideas, ‘you may see ’‚ ‘ one may see '‚ a common phrase in
Plautus: Aul. 506, Capt. 420, Mil. 94, Poen. 831, 836 (cf. 585 con-
spiczQas) Ter. Haut. 619; in subordinate clauses, Cist. 2 5 Cure. 292,
’11111. 914. Ι11 Bacch. 27, Men. 111 the‘ you' is not indefinite. This
kind of subjunctive is generally called‘ potential’; but a ‘’shall (used
without any sense of command or resolve) would often be effective, if
somewhat old-sashioned, English for this Latin subjunctive: cf. Hor. Sat.
Ι. 4. 86, ΙΙ. 2. 114, Verg. Georg. I. 387, Juv. XIV. 42. Compare the
Elizabethan use of ‘ shall' in precisely similar expressions (‘you shall
see '‚ ‘ you shall find ³), referred to by Abbott in his Shakespearian Gram-
mar‚ § 315. For similar subjunctives of other verbs see Most. 259,
278, and, in subordinate clauses, 73, 197.

probus homo sum, ‘ a knowing fellow am I !’ Probus not 111 the
moral sense, as in 133, but like uictu probo 730, ‘ fine fare’; cf. 011
probe 4,

244. quae. .patronum,‘ a woman to plead my cause, a very ad-
vocate‘. The emendation patmnam (cf. Asin. 292, Rtid. 261) is
unnecessary. For order of words cf. Capt.Pr01. 12.

246. eius eausa,‘ on account of him', i. e. ‘for speaking against
him '.

248. cedo, ‘give me' ;cf. 258, &c. (‘ tell me' 47 8): lit.‘ give here',
from the demonstrative ce ‘here' (=the enclitic 111 Ιιι- c, zllz'- -ε, &c.) and
do ‘ give ’ (an old imperative of dare, from the root do*- -).

249. adueniat, prospective subjurictive; see on 148.

250. mulier quae . . . ei=mulieri quae or quae mulier . . . ez'; cf.
985 f., Capt. 110—12 istos captiuos duos quos emi . . . lzz’s indito catenas,
Trin. 137 ille (=z'llum) qui mandauit, exlurbastz' ex aedibus? So
Vergil Αε11.1573 uthem quam (= quam urbem) statuo uestta est.

aetatem, ‘’person ; cf. Rud. 1346 Venus eradzcet caput atque
aetatem tuam, and the common phrase uae aetalz tuae, ‘confound you‘.

251. speculo speculum, ‘when the looking· glass has the best of
looking- glasses 111 yourself (and your e) es)'‚ i. e. you are y‘oursclf the
glass of sashion and the mould of form’ ; cf. Henry IV. Pt. II. 2, 3
‘he vvas indeed the glass wherein the noble youth did dress thern-
selves.

253 aliquid peculi, ‘something of your own' ‘something sor your-
self’. Note the pun sspeculum, peculzum) and cf. on 268. From an
article 111 Phillipps' Glossary, 4626, peculum: speculum, it might almost
seem as if the s of speculum was sometimes not pronounced.

Philematium. Note the sudden turn (παρὰ προσδοκίαν) from
Scapha to Philematium. Since Scapha has made such a pretty speech,
he will reward—Philematium.

mea. Diminutives in -z'um denoting female persons are always
feminine 111 Latin: Charisius says (Ι. 15, p. 80- Ι. 104 1)‘ Leontzon et
