INTRODUCTION xi

v seven months, owing to the discovery that it was haunted.
In an admirable scene Tranio pretends that Theoropides has

himself incurred the resentment of the Ghost by knocking at
the door of his house, and so converts the ghost-story into
a matter of present and patent fact ; Theoropides is only too
glad to be able to escape with his head wrapped up in his
cloak (capite obuoluto 424).

But so far only the first difficulty has been overcome.
Theoropides returns when he has recovered from his fright,
having made inquiries of the person from whom he bought
the house : the latter has indignantly denied the whole story.
The situation is complicated by the appearance of the
money-lender Misargyrides, who demands payment of interest
long overdue. Tranio finds himself between two fires. But
he is equal to the occasion. He advises Theoropides to go
to law with the refractory vendor of the house. The debt
he does not deny, but explains it as a necessary means of
raising money lo buy another house, when the old one had to
be abandoned. He even induces Theoropides to promise
payment next day, and Misargyrides departs pacified.

‘Where then is this new house ?’ asks TheoropideS.
Tranio is in doubt for a moment, but decides to locate it
next door. Philolaches, he says, has bought the house of
his neighbour Simo, and at a ludicrously small figure. The
delight of the old man of business knows no bounds ς his
son is a chip of the old block. Yet another awkward demand
of Theoropides—that he should be shown over the house—
is met by the reminder that there are ladies therein, whose
permission must first be asked. (That Philolaches is not in
present possession of the house, but in the country, is not

explicitly stated in the text as we have it, but seems rather to ⁴

be assumed or inferred; cf. note on 929.) Theoropides
