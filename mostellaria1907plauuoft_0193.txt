449-469] NOTES ’ 107

449. usquin ualuisti Ρ ‘ have you kept in good health ¹? ’; usque
means ‘ uninterruptedly’ (see on 133): cf. the question and answer in
Merc. 387 usquin ualuz‘stz'? CHA. perpetuo recte. The form usquin
:usque-ne, the e being changed to i as in hicz'n for hice-ne 508.

factum optume, ‘thank heaven ! ⁹, ef. 1147, and on 33.

450. quid uos, insanin; for the punctuation cf. sed ego 362, sed tu
522.

quidum, ‘ how so, pray ⁰? '‚ see on 120.
sic, followed by quia, is equivalent to ‘ I will tell you ' ; lit. ‘in this
way’: cf. 1097 f. scies3 quia, Cure. 437 s. ego dicam tz‘bz'; quia, ibid.
442, Epid. 42, 69, Pseud. 336 f., 49¹·
451. ambulatis, ‘are promenading ’.
natus nemo ε cf. 402.

452. seruat, ‘ is attending to the door ἐ cf. Aul. 81 redi atque intus
serua, Cist. 103, Ter. Eun. 780 solus Sannio seruat domi. This meaning
is closely connected with the meaning ‘to watch’‚ which we have in
such instances as Ovid‚ Met. I. 627 cetera (se. lumina ‘ eyes ’) seruabant,
ibid. 684 seruantia lumina.

neque respondeat, loosely, for neque qui respondeat: cf. Sjogren,
De Particulz's C opulatz'uis, p. 11 2 f Respondere, ‘ to answer the door ’,
seems to represent the Greek ὑπακούεινε cf. Plato, Crito 43 Α, Phaed. 59 Ε.
, 454. eho, ‘what?', introducing a question, as in 178, 1083 ; cf. 843.

460. quid iam? ‘Why s0?’: cs. 1081 and on 365.

462. si non tangerem, ‘ if I was not to touch them ’.

464. faxint: sc. ut pereas. ‘ Faxz'nt occultius id notat quod perduint
apertius’. Bentley on Ter. Hec. 1. 2. 59.

465. istos prob. :omnis tuos 463.

467. et may perhaps be explained like the et of 426; or possibly
a verse has been lost after 466.

468. attigatis (ante—classical) for attingatis: cf. ne attigas Bacch.
445, Epid. 723, Truc. 276, caue attzgras Pers. 816. Similarly tago for
tango Mil. 1092 ('?), and the old adj. tagax cited by Festus 359, Miill.
and Nonius 408. 39 from Lucilius (1031, Marx). For the form of
prohibition (ne with pres. subj.) see on 74.

469. See critical note. As the text stands it can only be explained as
follows: ‘you too touch the earth', sc. as Ι am doing, or as I have
told Theoropides to do (in a line lost after 466). Touching the earth
has to be explained as a sign of appeal to the Manes: cf. Hom. Il. ix.
568 πολλὰ δὲ καὶ γαῖαν πολυφόρβην χερσῖν ἀλοία (‘she beat the earth
with her hands ’) κικλήσκουσ’ Ἀΐδην καὶ ἐπαινὴν Περσεφόνειαν, Hymn to

Tellurem dicit, manibus terram tangit). See also Longworth in Class.
Rev. XIII. p. 272 on Pseud. 351 terra(m) tetzgit.
