amabo, ‘ please ’‚ see on 166.
asta, ‘ stand up ’.

32 5. alumnus, ‘ your baby ’3 for Delphium is supporting him in her

arms.
mel meum : cf. the Irish expression ‘ my honey ' (mo mlzil).

326. 111 uia accubas, ‘ sit down in the street ’ : accubere is probably
an old hyr-form of accumbere; cf. attagen for attingere, 468; hence the
perfect accubui. In 343, 368 accubas is indic. from accubare.

32 7. lectus, the triclinium. Trans. freely ‘the table is laid '.

Note the prospective pres, indic. with prius.. quam, and cf. on 6 54.

328. ne sine ‘not without! The answer of the girl suits this very
well: Callidamates has his arms round her, while she is supporting him.

330. iacentis, ‘ where we lie’.

333. em tene, ‘ there, take it ', i. e. my hand. This is a common
meaning oftene in Plautus, see Truc. 696 A S T. cedo manum. S T R . lene ;
similarly with other accusatives Cas. 490, Rud. 1128, 1360, Pers. 413,
Truc. 537, 540, 6873 cf. Amph. 1076 quis me tenet? Most. 719

atque infortunatus.

probe, ‘ soundly ', cf. on 4.

343. quin accubas? ‘ why don't you sit down?’, a question ·

equivalent to a command or request, ‘ sit down ’ ; cf. quin mittis :⁹ 572,
quin is? 815, quin uenis? 1131. This use is common to old Latin and
classical Latin. In most instances the present tense seems similar to
that in statements denoting resolve; see on 261. If so, quin accubas?
means literally ‘ why will you not sit down? ’ Compare quin aspice?
(imperative) ‘ why not look? ’ 172. Contrast, however, instances like
Cas. 99 quin ruri es? ‘why are you not in the country?' where the
present tense has its ordinary meaning, as also in instances of quin with
the indic. in statements, 168.
344. ini, i.e. to Callidamates, who refuses the proffered cup.
