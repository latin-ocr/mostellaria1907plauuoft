160 MOSTELLARIA [66-5-716

665. audiui esse P, ESSEAUDIUI A (which is accentually less
rhythmical).—After this line Acidalius‚ followed by Ritsch1‚ inserted the
line which in ΑΡ follows 609.

667. 1 have written quidquid est dicundum for quidquid dei dieunt
P; quidquid est futurum Seyffert (cf. 847, Cure. 694, Mil. 311, 585,
1372, Truc. 2 54; quidquid futurumst, Ter. Hec. 669), but then id creates
difficulty because it would naturally refer to quidquid—Scan with hiatus
1(and slight pause> at the caesura. -quz'd cst forms the rise of the first

00t.
S l61711-1679. So A: names of speakers according to Seyffert and (678)
c oe .

675. Hiatus at caesura.

681. ne an P, AU'I' A.

682. oras P, ROGASI A.

686. Hiatus at caesura, with slight pause.

687. ipsus P, INTUS A.

689. HUC AB²C‚ huno B1D. (Plautus regularly uses accedere, as
a verb of motion, either absolutely, cf. 543, 717, or else followed by ad,
e. g. Mil. 494 accedam ad hominem, Pseud. 312, &c.; in Epid. 149
accedam periculum the verb is metaphorical.)

690-746. The THIRD CAN‘rrcuM falls into two sections :—

(A) 690-717, cretdim. ÷ either -ω-ὐρ (like 108), or -ωύψρ
(like 336), or έυ- Ι Lug (eret. dim.).
(Β) 718-746, mostly cretic tetrameters (down to 740).

699. It is curious that P add nunc before domi, making a correct
tetrameter (but out of place here).

701. In A ei comes after cenandum. P have an unexplained ni
trahis before male.

703. Ι have added eam (atque eam =‘ and that '‚ ‘ and what is more ') ;
so Spengel ‘ De versu cretico '‚ p. 37: in Reformvorschl'age, p. 88, he
proposes Si quis dotatam habet uxorem atque anum or Si quis uxorem
habet dotatam atquc anum.

709. For haec P Ι have written dc hac, which gives a construction
to 710 and removes the hiatus in 709. The clause quam . . . male
cannot be a dependent exclamation ; for it makes no sense, after 706 f..
to say ‘And I don’t know about your wives' tempers, but I know
how badly mine treats me ' ; he ought to say ‘ And . . . tempers, but 1
know that mine will treat me worse than ever ' (i. e. in consequence of my
running away from her). For quam P have written quac.

710. Syllaba anceps (ford) at diaeresis: cf. 326, 337.

711. Si supplied by Camerarius. The copyist of the archetype
may have regarded it as representing SIMO, and so have omitted it
as a mistake. Besides si is often omitted in MSS. 3 cf. emendations in
62, 912, and Sjogren ‘ Zum Gebrauch des Futurums ’‚ p. 158 and p. 62,
note.—The line is irregular in having three resolved rises in the cretic
dimeter.

716. Instead of this line A has a repetition of 714 in a slightly
different yet perfectly metrical form ε <ΤΕΜΡΠ>8ΝΠΝΟΕΒΤΜῙΚΙ-
