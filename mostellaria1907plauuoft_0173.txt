196-21'1] NOTES 87

—Aetas is here used absolutely for ‘ old age' (aetas senecta Aul. 2 5 3,
Trin. 43, aetas mala Men. 758), so in 8403 sometimes it is used
absolutely for‘ youth’ (= aetas integra Pseud. 203, or aetatula Most.
217, Rud. 894), haud aetati optabzle Bacch. 161, aetas et corpus tene·
rum, ‘youth and a delicate body’, Afranius. In elassical Latin both
5011505 are found· , see Dict.

197. non spero, ‘ Ι hope not'; cf. 798· haud opinor, ‘ I think not‘ ,
146, 270, 820 non uideor, ‘ I think (that). .,no't 978 f. non aio, ‘1 say
no’ : so often in classical Latin e.g .Cic. pro Rosc. Am. 4.10 'id quod
non spero,‘ as Ihope will not be theg case ',) and in Greek οὔ φημιε -nego,
οὐκ ἐθέλω-ἑ nolo, οὐχ ἥδομαιε doleo.

insperata, &c. z cf.‘ it is the unexpected that happens' , ‘ ce n ’est
que l'inattendu qui arrive.’
spereS, ‘ one expects ’ ; cf. on 73.

199. sim . . . fui. Note the change of mood and cf. 969 and note on
149.

200. 11111110 ego quam 1111110 tu amata sum. This seems to be one
of those abbreviated forms of speech in which something corresponding
to the qnam is understood in the principal clause. But the abl. nihilo
creates a difficulty. without it, we might understand tam: ‘I have
been loved as much as you are now'; so Rud. 943 non edepol piscis
expeto quam tui sermonis sum infigens, ‘ I don't want your fisbes so
much as I desire a talk with you’, Men. 968 f., cf. Rud. 1301, Bacch.
549, Merc. 761. (For tam. . . quam with amare cf. Mil. 1202.) If,
however, the nihilo of the MSS. is sound‚ we must understand the
comparative minus: ‘I have been loved not a whit less than you are
now '. For this the only parallels hitherto suggested are passages in
which quam :potius (or magis or plus) quam, e. g. Rud. 684 certumst
moriri quam hunc pati, ibid. 1114 tacitast bona mulier semper quam
loquens, Men. 726, Bacch. 618, Poen. 747, Sallust Jug. 82, Catil. 9,
Tacitus Ann. 1. 58. See further in critical note.

202. me is superfluous, but gives additional emphasis: cf. tu in 15 f.,
mihi Aul. 551 f.

203. stimulatrici, ‘ temptress '‚ ‘fixe-brand of a woman ’.

204. With this and following line cf. Asin. 163—5.

AR. So'lus solitudine ego ted a'tque ab egestate a‘pstulz':
So‘lus si ductim, referre gratiam numquam potes·
CL. So'lus ductatd, si semper so‘lus quae poscam dabis.
207. For omission of the verb est cf. on 33.
, 1111111 1111 esse, &C.‚ ‘ that I am a beggar for her sake’.

210. ultro, ‘into the bargain, i. e. after having given you your
freedom (quod quaerebas). In such passages the original sense of ultro
comes out—‘ be) ond’ (cf. ultra); it is almost like porro, ‘further' : cf.
Pers. 327 et multer ut szt lzbera atque ipse ultro det argentum,‘ that he
himself may have to pay mone) ento the bargam'. Ussing explains

‘uel sine mutuo tuo amore’ i. 0. ‘without any love 011 your part'‚
and compares Men. 359.
21 1. perdiderit tantum argenti, ‘just so much money will he find
