gratum together in the present passage ; but animus graius, ‘ gratitude ’
and animus ingratus (admitted by mistake in Lodge’s excellent Plautine
Lexicon, p. 130, Bacch. 394) are not Plautine phrases.

221. id extudj, ‘ got it out of him '. The clauses priusquam ia
extudi and quom illi subblandiebar are parallel to one another and both
relative to olim.

222. Philolaches is fond of beginning his speeches with an oath: cf.
161, 170, 191, 206. Note the humour of this particular one, which
imputes impotent malevolence to the gods; cf. 435. The word diui,
‘ gods ', is well supported by MSS. in Plautus : Aul. 50 (an oath), 300,
Amph. 1121, Merc. 842, Mil. 730, Rud. Ptol. 9.

me. This looks at first sight like an imitation 01 the Greek ποιεῖν
τινά τι. But me is to be regarded as the abl. : ‘ let the gods make ol
me '=‘ let the gods do to me '. The nearest parallels are 1166 quid me
fiet ? (=quid mihi accidet ?)‚ Mil. 299 quid fuat me ? Trin. 157 si quid
eosuerit (= εἴ τι πάθοι), Poen. 1085. In instances like the following the
abl. denotes more strictly the person or thing witlc which something is
done, or ofwlziclz something is made: 346, 636, Mil. 459 quid facies ea
(machaera) ? Pseud. 88, Truc. 799 quid eo fecisti puero ? Capt. 952,
&c. For instances in which the dative is used with facere and fieri see

242ᾗὸ. tibi sat, acceptumst, ‘ you feel assured'. Satis accipere (dare,

exigere) are legal terms=‘ to take (give, exact) security ' ; cf. Stich.

uictum sempiternum, ‘ provision for lise ⁹.

225. tibi proprium, ‘your own for ever'3 cf. Aen. 1. 73 Conubia
iungam stabili propriamque dicabo.

226. capiundas crinis, ‘assume the matron’s plaits ’‚ or (sreely) ‘ put
on th'e matron’s cap ’‚ i. e. ‘ play the matron ’ ; cf. Mil. 791 f. At
marriage the hair of a Roman maiden was divided into six plaits (called
crines) with the so·called hasta caelibaris (called hasta recurua by
Ovid, Fasti ΙΙ. 560) ; cf. Festus, p. 339 Senis crinibus nubentes ornantur.
The custom, which was a specially Roman one, is discussed by Plutarch,
Quaestiones Romanae, 87, where several different explanations of its
origin are suggested. Jevons (Intr. to ‘ Romane Questions ', p. xxxiii)
sayS‚ ‘ The use osan iron javelin point is probably due to the dangers
which, in the opinion of primitive man, attend on those about to marry,
and require to be averted by the use of iron ’. A more old—fashioned
