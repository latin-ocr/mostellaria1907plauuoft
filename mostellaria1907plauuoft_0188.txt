371. quid faciam? The unsuitability of the term ‘deliberative

of fact; the questioner asks what he is to da, and the answer is given by
an imperative or other expression os command. Quzd ego agam? 378
differs in so far as no answer is given or perhaps expected3 hence the
term ‘deliberativess which does not go to the root of the matter. In
Greek, too, an answer is frequently expected and given, e. g. Aristoph.

in the next line.
