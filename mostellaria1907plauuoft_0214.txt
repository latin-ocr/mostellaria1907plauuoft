128 MOSTELLARIA [84o-8 50

non qujs=uequis 837.

842. latius demum, &c., i. e. quom latius itteris, id demum operae
pretium est, ‘it ’s not worth your while until you have gone further’;
Langen compares Mero. 907 seruata res est demum, si illam uidero, i. e.
tum demum. ..si Bacch. 271 f. damnatus demum. .reddidit=tum
demum r. postquam d. est.

latius for longius iutro is, as Lorenz says, very strange.

843. eho, ‘ho’ ; see on 178.

puere (ef. on 308), addressed to a slave' m the house.

circumduce: cf. on 60.

844. ductarem almost=ducerem. Plautus is very rond of frequen-
tatives‚ cf. uictitare 54, mantare 116, rogitare 368, recursare 581, datare
602, territare 609, obiectare 810.

845. Theoropides, in excellent humour, plays upon the ambiguous
words circumducere and ductore. per-ductor, for metrical reasons,
instead of circumductor, ‘ a misleader! Strong translates nihil moror
ductarier ‘ I'd rather not be taken in': cf. perducere Hor. Sat. II. 5, 77.

847. quidquid est, ‘ come what may’, ‘in any event’, ef. Mil. 311
hercle, quidquid est (⁴ come what may ⁹), mussabo potius quam inteream
male, Truc. 254, Cure. 694.

perductet: for the subjunct. cf. on 230.

848. aedis dieo, Ἰ am referring to the house' ,=aedis (accus. plur.)
perductorem deco, ‘I mean some one to conduct you through the
house' ·sor the accuS. depending on a noun of verbal character cf. iusta
orator Amph. Prol. 34, and note on 100 above.

ergo. ,igitur-2 in this apparently pleonastic expression the two
words have not exactly the same meanings. igitur means ‘'then (see
on 132), ergo, ‘well', as in 1119; or ‘indeed’. This' 15 a sense which
ergo often has in Plautus, though it is not etymologically connected
with the Greek* εργῳ· , cf. Epid. 477 haec ergostfidicina ; hic alia nullast,
‘ this is indeed (really) the lute-gir13 there is none other here', Bacch.
125, &c. Hence the combination ergo igitur, which recurs in one
other passage (Trin. 756, a question). For ergo in surprised questions
see 972.

849. mane uideam, parataxis; cf. mane: hoc quod coepi primum
enarrem Ter. Haut. 273, Plaut. Cas. 999 opinor credam, Trin. 1136,
cedo 373, uis 578.

uideam ne : cs. 966, Capt. 127 uisam ne . . . turbauerint.

850. est, ‘ off with you ! ' It has been shown by Spengel and Richter
(Studem. Stud. p. 506 f.) that the est which appears in all the MSS. in
this passage is a genuine La'tin interjection, employed in scaring away
animals, and different from the st=‘ hist’ which is used in enjoining
silence (cf. 489, 506).

Dogs were commonly kept at the door of a Roman or Greek house;
here either a live dog, or, as suggested by Thompson, a stuffed ‘ property
dog‘ becomes visible on the opening of the door: see Class. Rev. IV,
p. 381, XX. p. 440.

abin : see on 261 (instances with the 2nd person).
