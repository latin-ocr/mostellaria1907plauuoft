and iam. Instead of the trisyllabic nunciam we find nunc iam (two
syllables> in Capt. 266 nunc iam cultros attinet, Epid. 135; cf. Rud.
l &c.

3'43’5. ne (sometimes written nae) is an interjection = ‘ verily ', Greek νή
(ναί), and does not, of course, involve the subjunctive: cf. Trin. 62,
Men. 256, Mil. 571.

praeterhac = posthac, Men. 112, 725, Rud. 1117, Stich. 345.

faeere moram with the dat. is a periphrasis for morari with the
accuS. in the sense of ‘to stand in any one‘s way', ‘to keep any one
waiting' : similarly in Verg. Ecl. ΙΙΙ. 52 in me mora non erit ulla means
not ‘ I will not delay‘, but ‘ Ι will not stand in your way ', ‘ I will not
say you nay‘ ; the other sense of mora (intrans, as in haud mora:
‘ quickly ’) is denied by Langen, Beitr'age, p. 169 ff„ to be Plautine.—n0n
facies ‘ you shall not cause ’‚ future of resolve ; see on 229.—Here Tranio
leaves the stage (by door to left of spectators), to purchase provisions
in the market at the Piraeus.

76. satin abiit ‚⁹ ‘ So he has gone ζ’ more lit. ‘Has he really
(positively) gone?’ This use of satin, almost equivalent to an interroga·
tive particle, here num or an, springs from the sense ‘ quite’ : thus in
166 satin haec me uestis deceat?' ‘is this dress quite becoming to me ? ⁷
650 satin intellegis? ‘do you quite understand'?’ Trin. 1177 satine
saluae [sc. res tuae sunt] ‚2 ‘is all quite right?' Men. 510 satin sanus
es ? ‘ are you quite in your right senses ἶ) ’ It is but a slight step to such
cases as Trin. 925 satine latuit? ‘ is it possible that he has been skulk-
ing?’ and the present passage. The phrase always has an emotional
character, expressive of indignation or joy.

77. obsecro nostram fidem, ‘ I appeal to your protection ’.

80. redit, a prospective present indie. <see on 654). Similarly
periere = perierint.

82. mensum, the oldest form of the gen. plur. of mensis and the
only one found in the poets (stem mens-) : mensium and mensuum are
later formations; see Wagener, Beitrage zur lat. Gram, 1905, p. 17 f.

relictae reliquiae, a ‘figura etymologica'3 cf. the common phrases
seruitutem seruire, facinus facere (460, 777), turbas turbare (Bacch.
107), dicta dicere (Trin. 77), &c. Possibly Plautus may here have found
in his Greek original something like λέλειπται λείψανα combined with
the gen. ὂλξγων μηνῶν, ‘there are only leaving& enough for a few

months,rleft . ’ ”

’“ 83. eccum is a compound of ecce (cf. 496, 660] and hum (ε lzmz-c,
without the demonstrative suffix), like eccam (= ecce llam), eccos (= ecce
lios), eccas (= ecce has), eccillum, eccillam, eccilhcd, eccistam, the accusa-
tive pronoun being the object of ecce; cf. ecce me ‘ behold me ἱ ’ Rud. 241.
Thus eccum, literally ‘ behold him ', may form a complete sentence; see
Most. 1127 atque eccum optume, and 560, Mil. 25, Pers. 226, &c. But
these compounds are frequently inserted parenthetically in a sentence
which is complete without them, and are then hardly more than
equivalent to a simple ecce, ‘behold '. So here, ‘ I see my masters son
behold him’ = ‘behold, I see my master’s son'; cf. 611, 686, 1120,
