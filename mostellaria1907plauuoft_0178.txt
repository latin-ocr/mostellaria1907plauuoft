92 MOSTELLARIA [2 53-256

Chrysion et Phanion ex neutris Graecis feminina nostri ecere'. Thus
in Plautus and Terence we find mea Philematium (Most. 295), Delphium
mea (Most. 343), banc meam Erotium (Men. 300), mea suauis amabilis
amoena Stephanium (Stich. 736), etc. So Martial V. 34. 3 paruula nc
nigras horrescat Erotion umbras, cf. X. 61. 1. So too in Greek : ἡ
Γλυκέριον, ἡ Λεόντιον. In both languages, where form and meaning
come into collision as affecting the gender of nouns denoting persons,
the form gives way to the meaning in nearly all cases. Even puer is
occasionally fem. in old Latin (=puera or puella), e. g. sancta puer
Saturni, Livius Andron. Od. 15.

254- suo quique (or quicque) loco is an idiomatic expression
in old Latin sor ‘all in order', lit. ‘in its proper place severally':
so Poen. 1178 tanta zbi copia uenustatum aderat m suo qutque
loco sita munde, Stich. 62 ιη suo quicque (AB, quique CD) loco,
Titinius 130 munde facite zn suo quique loco. The form qusque
must bc regarded as an archaic ablative of quisque—a rare form,
but cf. Lachmann on Lucr. 11. 371, and notes on qui Most. 58,
ali- -quc' 174, etc.; for the omission ofin cf. Amph 568, Rud. 907. [Suo
quicque loco, ‘each thing in its own place', is simpler; but it has been
proved by Madvig on Cic. de Fin. V. 17, 46 (cuiusque partis sua quae
que uis: sua cui'usquepartzs uis) that the attraction of quisque to the
case of suus, by which suus quisque becomes practically a single word,
is good Latin; and in Poen. 1 178 quicque, though found in the Ambro-
sian‚ is impossible] In the present passage the phrase probably forms
an inde-pendent sentence, with cst omitted (as in 33, etc.): for, apart
from the order of words, it is not strictly applicable to capillus (‘ each
hair in its proper place ⁹), as Seyffert has noticed.

uide capillum, satin compositust commod03 the subject of
the dependent question is ‘ anticipated ' as the object of the principa-nl
clause, cf. 282 contempla aurum et pallam, satin llaec me deceat (con-
trast 166 contempla . . . satin haec me uestis deceat), 969 (note), Pers.
635 patriam te rogo quae sit, Rud. 293, 353, 1068, Capt. 376, etc. For
the indic. mood in dependent questions os this class cf. Capt. 557 uiden
tu hunc quam inimico uoltu intuitur ἒ Rud. 592 lenonem quid agit
uisam ; and see note on 149.

255. commoda . . . commodum, ‘so long as you yourself are ac-
commodating, be sure that your hair is comme il saut ’. Scapha plays
upon the word commodus, which has two senses in Plautus: (i) of things,

a‘ll right’ , comme il saut, so Trin.1117 commoda eueniunt, Asin. 725
minae commodaest of full weight', Most 254commode,‘ neatly', ‘tidily';
cf. on Trin. 400; (ii) of persons, ‘accommodating’, ‘obliging’, e. g.
Mil. 642 conuzua commodus, ‘agreeable‘ , Cic. de Amic. ξ 54 mores
commodi, &c., Most. 853 commode, ‘kindly '. Incommodus has corre·
sponding senses; (i) ‘not as it should be'‚ cf. Most. 418 ‘ unpleasant
(consequences) ’, 807 ‘ inconvenient ’; (ii) ‘ disagreeable ’‚ cf. Asin. 62
inportuna atque incommoda, &c.; so Hor. Epist. Ι. 18, 75 incommodus
angat.
