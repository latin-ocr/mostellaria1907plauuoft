66 · MOSTELLARIA [25.53

25. peregre, ‘ abroad’, with sense of motion toward53 so 976. On
the other meanings of peregre see note on Capt. I. 2. 64, and cf. Most.
374, 611, &c. (‘ from abroad’).

26. curatam, cf. 107 bonae quom curantur male.

29. quom his factis studet, ‘now that he goes in for this sort of
thing’; quom, whether temporal, causal (as here), concessive or adversa·
tive, ordinarily takes the indicative in Plautus; cf. 107, 149, 168, 432,
695, 720, 766, 858, 1128, 1156; 221, 1117 have temporal imperfect
indie. For special uses of the subjunctive with quom see on 148 (prospec-
tive), 158 (fuit quom), 896 (adversative). [A disputed passage in
Plautus is Truc. 381, where our two families of MSS. contradict one
another : A has quom sordebamus, P have quom sorde-emus]

30. quo nemo, &c., ‘ one who ere this hadn't his equal sor thrift or
his superior sor sobriety ’. ,

,, adaeque is a specially Plautine word (= aeque), used only in
negative sentences ; cf. Cist. 5 5 neque munda adaeque es ut soles, Capt. 999
nulla adaequest A echeruns atque ubi egofui in lapicidinis. In the text
the second member of the comparison is expressed by the ablative
(quo = ‘ in eomparison with whom ') ; so Cas. 684 s. neque est nequesuit
me senex quisquam amator adaeque miser (me = ‘ as I ’); cf. the abl.
aster aeque in Amph. 293 nullus hoc metuculosus aeque, and Cure. 141.
This phrase appears strange on first acquaintance, but is really the
same phenomenon as the abl. after a comparative; both comp. and
adaeque may be followed by quam (cf. Stich. 274, 217) and therefore by
the abl. (which expresses the standard in both cases). In Capt. 828
and Merc. 335, we have a comparative combined with adaeque, aeque
(adaeque fortunatior, miserior aeque) and followed by the abl.

32. Note the alliteration and cf. 111, 143, 164 f.‚ 245 (pronounce
Pilolakes), 312, 353, 536, 550, 963, 976, 1171. For alliterations with
other letters see notes on 41, 135, 170, 218, 352, 733.

in aliam partem p. p.‚ ‘ bears the palm (or, in the slang phrase,
‘ takes the cake ’) for the very opposite'.

33. uirtute tua, ‘thanks to you', ‘ owing to yon'; so Truc. 741 de
eo nunc bene sunt tua uirtute, and ef. Most. 173 uirtute formae, Aul. 166
uirtute deum, Trin. 355, 643, Mil. 676. Virtute is not to be taken
εἰρωνικῶς as Lambinus says it may be.

factum without est. This seems to be one of those sentences of an
exclamatory character, in which the usage of Plautus was to omit the
verb; (trans. ‘ all this owing to you and your tutoring ! '); cf. 207 bene
hercle factum, ‘ one to me 1 ’ ‘ right Ι was ‘‚ Persa 775 tua factum opera,
‘all owing to you ἒ ’ Bacch. 295 sapienter factum a uobis, ‘a sensible
thing to d0!’ Trin. 429 sactum ‘too true!‘ Stich. 375 nimis factum
bene, ‘ capital ! ’ cf. Pseud. 361, 1099; so Capt. 176 facete dictum, ‘very
good! ’ Most. 159 euentus rebus omnibus; this is especially common
with mirum, e.g. Men. 338 minume hercle mirum, ‘ no wonder Ξ ' and
in the phrases mirum ni, mirum quin, mirum quid, Amph. 319, Most.
493, Amph. 954. In such cases as Trin. 127, where factum is in reply
to the question dedisti argentum? the omission of est gives a certain.
