166 MOSTELLARIA [1113-1179

with confidence: the letters desti- are the chief difficulty. My pro-
visioual emendation follows the lines of Seyffert, who with the MSS.
assigns the line to Tranio (T R. numquam edepol hodie hinc inuitus
surgam — υ -υ- .

1114. So Pylades), for Iubeo (lubo or iube) ignem et. samen P.

1 116. qula place· is a legitimate proceleusmatic.

1120. nunc supplied by Redslob.

1122. So Mffller, for omnium P. sepelire: ‘to get rid of.'

1124. Scan with hiatus either after modo or after hominem-In the
last foot of the line the final s of ludificatus is to be dropped in scanningz
so Rud. 103, 512, &c. This principle, mentioned by Cicero (Orat.
ξ 161), may be illustrated by Lucretius (z'nfantz‘bu’ paruis, &c.).

1 127. Scan with hiatus after pacem (pause before full stop).

1134. ista P. The nent. sing. istud and plur. ista are rare in
Plautus (for istuc, istaec), but are not to be abolished from the text3 see
Neue Lat. F ormenl. ΙΙ. pp. 399, 401 f. ac te Ussing (for acto P), whom
1 have also followed in giving the whole line to Callidamates. This
suits the sed tu of 1135 better than to follow the MSS. in giving Dic . . .
taces? to Tranio: see on 522.

113 5. Scan with hiatus at the pause before inscitissumus.

1136. eloquere Langen, for loquere P. Langen shows from 200
plassag)es that lloquj= ‘to give information ⁹ (followed by dependent noun

1144-1146p. Lacunae in P, supplied by Ritschl.

1 149. Restored by Biicheler and Leo: si amicus depln‘lo aut
phssomontes P.

1 157. Scan with hiatus at diaeresis.

1160. empla- supplied by Ritschl; so too iam 463.

1165. Scan with hiatus after supplici ; cf. on 999.

1 166. ΤΚ. post supplied by Miiller.

1168. te supplied by Guyet.

1169. amitte Ussing, for remitte P, which is defended by Ahlberg,
De Proceleusmalz‘cis‚ p. 52, in spite of the ictus on the unaccented
syllable (remitte). For the mistake of the MSS. cf. 1 172.

1172. Lacuna in P, supplied by Ritschl. astat Ritschl, for restat P.

1173. quiesce, (si) sapis Camerarius, for quiesse sapis P; si sapis
stands as a dactyl in the 4th foot‚ cf. Curc. 167, Aoin. 149, Epid. ²023
in the 5th‚ Amph. 311.

1174. So Acidahus, for uerberibus ut sit. quietus P; the failure of
the word-accent at the fifth rise is compensated by the word-accent on
the seventh ; possibly too uerberibus had a secondary accent on the first
syllable (uerberibus).

1175. Hiatus at change of speakers.

1 177. So Ritschl‚ for unam noxiam unam queso fao P.

R 1d179.61 have written ibidem for ibi P; for scansion (ibraem) see on
