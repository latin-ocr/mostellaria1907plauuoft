'172-183] ’ NOTES 85

regarded as questions and printed with a note of interrogation ; in some
at least of the above passages it improves the sense or makes the con-
strucfion syntactically intelligible, especially where the imperative is
part of a sentence introduced by quin with indic. (e. g. Most. 815, Capt.
636, Asin. 254). [See further on 572, 614, and article in the Classical
Review for April 1902, where quin noli illudere ? is suggested as the
Latin parallel to οὐ μὴ σκώψῃς ;]. .

173. uirtute formae, ‘ thanks to your beauty ' : cf. on 33. The late
rrofi Sell‘ar quoted Bums : ’

‘And then there 's something iu her gait,
Gars ony dress look weel'.

174. ergo, ‘very well then’ (in a tone of approval); cf. Amph. 378
ME R C. quoius es ? S O. Amphitruonis, inquam, Sosia. ME. ergo istoc
magis . . . uapulabis, ‘ Whose slave are you ‘r‘ ’ ⁴ Ι say I am Amphitruo's
Sosia.‘ ‘Very well! (in a threatening tone) for that statement you
shall be flogged the more.’ In these passages ergo has clearly illative
force, referring, however, not to the contents of the statement made by
the previous speaker, but to the fact that the statement had been made:
i. e. it means ‘ for saying that‘‚ a sense which is here made more
explicit by ob istuc uerbum, and in the Amph. passage by istoc. For
further developments of ergo see on 848 (‘ indeed’, ‘really ' ) and 972.
The English ‘ why' (non-interrogative) may often be used as a trans-
lation.

aliqui, old abl. of aliquis (cf. Aul. Prol. 24, si qui :ef πως Trin.
120), serving for all genders and either number: so qui :qua (fem.
relat.) 258‚=quz'bus Capt. 1003, quicum? :quocum? Most. 519. So
in class. prose, where both relative and interrogative senses are found :
e. g. Cic. de Fin. XXVI. 85, pro Rosc. Am. XXVII. 74, de Amic. VI. 22.

178. eho, (Ι) expresses surprise, anger, or derision (⁶ oho Ξ ’ ‘ zounds ! ‘
&c.) before a question, as here and 454, Trin. 933, 942, Rud. 578
elzo an . . . ‚ Mil. 435 eho quis . . . , Poen. 263 elzo amabo quid . . .:
(2) calls the attention of the person addressed (‘ ho! ’ ‘ harkye Ξ ’) before
a vocative or a command, e. g. ello tu Trin. 5 5, eho Pseudole Pseud. 348,
Men. 432, eho dic milti Capt. 62 3, eho circumduce Most. 843.

falso, ‘ undeservedly '; uero, ‘deservedly‘ : uero is here a modal
abl.‚ lit. ‘according to truth ’, ‘on true grounds ' ; so iu Capt. 567 (‘ in
reality ’), Asin. 568 : cf. Seneca, de Clem. ΙΙ. 2. 2 maluerim ueris offen-
dere quam placere adulando.

179. uel, ‘ even ': equidem uel multo malo, ‘ I for my part go so sar
ἓεειῑῗ) greatly prefer': note on 299. Langen here trans. ‘ wenn's so

ie t’.

falso tamen=quamuis falso, cf. Capt. 404, Ter. Eun. 170 tamen
contemptus abs te haec habui in memoria. So Verg.‚ Ecl. VIII. 20
extrema moriens lamen alloquor liora3 cf. Thuc. VII. 75 ἡ ἷσομοιρία
τῶν κακῶν, ἔχουσά τινα ὅμως κούφισιν, οὐδ’ ὣς ῥᾳδία ἐδοξάζετο. The
παρὰ προσδοκίαν is like 1007—‘ to get praise, even tho’ undeserved, than
blame well merited‘. '

183. ita amarem is the reported form of ita Philolaches tuos te
