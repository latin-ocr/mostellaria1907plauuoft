622-663] CRITICAL NOTES 159

622-625 follow 628 in P, transposed by Ritschl, In 623 qui
inferior MSS, sor quid Ρ.

62 4f, These two lines are metrically defective in the MSS„ lacking
two ssyllable and one syllable respectively. The gap should probably
be soug ht at a distance of about five letters from the end. For in
the MgSS. 624, 625 stand next to 629 (see the preceding note) and
629 is defective before audio. The archetype was, therefore, probably
defaced near the end of all three lines. 1 have supplied nomen in 624
(changing qui P into quoi), and adopted Below‘s cx te in 625.

626. huic quod Miiller, for ΤΒ.. est huic P, which may possibly
be explained with Leo as a broken sentence (Tr. ‘ It is . . . Philolaches
owes him'); but a clause defining illuc suits the context better. I
have therefere made the answer of Tranio commence at 627. (Β
prefixes S to 626.)

627. paululum B, paulum CD. The diminutive in ·ulum seems
necessary in w'ew of the reply quantillum; otherwise the diminutive
form of the latter is meaningless—Dactylic words are unobjectionable
in the first foot of iambic merres (e. g. piscibus Rud. 513, omnibus
Trin. 54, 75, omnia Rud. 526, militis Bacch. 574, &c.); and even
cretic words are common, the last two syllables together forming the
rise of the foot, e. g. enicas Rud. 944 (see note); similarly with last
syllable long by position paulu‘lum above, quattu'or 630, neminem
Poen. 1348.

629. creditum FZ, credit P v‘with space in BJ.

630- 632. Of these lines only the first (630) appears in this place
in P; but it is probable that all three stood here on a lost page of
A, for three lines are needed to make up 2x1'z9-38 lines. They
were also read in this place by Servius3 and they make better sense
here than between 65 2 and 653, where they stand in the MSS.
(including Α). They were transposed by Ritschl, supported by Seyffert
in Berl. Phil. Wochenscrift‚ 1896, p. 253 f.

640 and 641 stand after 650 in P: transposed by Ritschl.

642. quoius· forms the rise of the fifth foot: cs. 817 f., 908

644, 645. speculzclaras Ellis, for speculo claras P, 9specul0claras
Spengel. -candorem Spengel, for canorem P. —Ritschl supposed two
half- lines to have been lost between ita and speculzclaras.

648. After this line Ritschl supposed a line to have fallen, out which
would have made ei 650) more intelligible.

651. meridies Saracenus‚ for meridie P.

652. uonzztu Bothe, for uomitum P.-After 652 stand 630-632 in

656. paemssume Pris c., edd.. planissume P.

663.. ..0 ‚MUMD —RDIE or PERCI'I'E A, proximum
mendacium Ρ. Ritschl, perceiving that the word mendaczum had
crept in from the end of 665, proposed rem conferam, which, however,
is inconsistent with the‘ ductus litterarum ’ rather uncertain) of A. No
satisfactory proposal has yet been made, Poss ibly nisi ut<i) uzcinum
hunc proxumum <re zmpcrtiam)‚‘ give our neighbour a hand in the
business' ;cf. Mil. 1060, Ter. Ad. 322 (malo), &c.
