114 MOSTELLARIA [567-591

(at the end of lines) nesrustrd sis, ‘don’t you make any mistake’, e.g.
Capt. 854, Men. 692.
570. pilum iniecisti, ‘ opened fire ’.
571. certe, see on 303.
inanis, ⁴ empty-handed '‚ so Bacch. 5 31 postquam inanis sum, ‘ now
my purse is empty ¹, ibid. 517, Trin. 701 (‘penniless‘), Asin. 660
(‘ unburdened ’), Pseud. 308, 371. So in classical Latin, Propertius V.
5. 47 si pulset inanis: cf. Jnv. X. 22 cantabit uacuus coram latrone
uiator; and κενός Soph. O. C. 359, &c. The common classical meaning
of ⁴ vain ', ‘ idle' is not found in Plautus, though it is in Terence (Hec.
344 laborem inanem).
est hariolus, ‘ can see into a mill-stone ⁹, ironically.

verbgs esc-tricare, ‘ to disentangle', ira-tricare, '‘ to entangle ’‚ ίνῑεανί, ‘ to
use entanglements ') z hence, like tramae (properly ‘ webs’, ‘ cobwebs '),
⁸ humbug' : Rud. 1323, Cure 613. The English ‘ trick ’ is of entirely
‘different origin.

That Tranio should answer the question of the money-lender with
another question seems specially suitable: cf. note on the interrogative
character of quin with the imperative, 172.

574-610. In 574—592 Tranio tries to get rid of the danista by
coaxing him, and promises to pay first the interest ( faenus 580), and
then the capital (sors 592), hoping that by this pretext he may gain
time. In 593 he adopts an abusive and threatening tone, and refuses to
pay the interest, holding out subsequently (599), as a sop, the promise
of paying the sors ε after 600 he loses his temper and defies his opponent
until Theor. interferes (610).

576. bona, ‘ healthy', ‘ powerful '.

110 clama. For ne with the pres. imperative see on 74.
577. clamo, ‘I do shout’ or ‘I will shout '‚ see on 261.
ah, gere m. m. ‘ah now, do listen to me '‚ coaxingly.
115785. ujs {eham' palrjaltaxis: the subjunctive is of the same nature as
t eaeamo t enext e.

579. abeam P, ‘go away?’=‘ 1 am to go away, am 1?‘ Here the
question echoes a command of another, and the subjunctive has its
independent injunctive meaning: cf. iubeam? 620, and contrast 556.
The danista is naturally surprised at the request abi domum, especially
aster the opportunus adu. of l. 574.

580. reddeturne: cf. on 508.

585. Line 584 is spoken in a loud and threatening voice; hence the
answer eu hercle, ‘ bravo! ’ i.e. ‘ stick to it! ε cf. on 241 and 586 euge
strenue. The sentence begun by 110 tu (either a prohibition or a state·
ment with n? =vr'1) is broken off impatiently.

586. After nominabo the money-lender calls out the name of
Philolaches (‘ extra versum ’, unless there is a lacuna): cf. 587, 616.

590. abiero: cf. on 526.

591. hoc uerbo, i. e. by doing what that word (reddere) implies.
