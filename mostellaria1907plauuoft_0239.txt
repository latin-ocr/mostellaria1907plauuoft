aro-241] CRITICAL NOTES 151

dimoric in Plautus (i. e. has approximately the length of two units of
time, instead of three). See Radford in Trans. qf Amer. Phil. Assoc.
1905, pp. 159 ff., and reference in Preface‚ p. vi, note 2.

211. If the order of the words in the MSS. is right we must scan
capite' tu- as a proceleusmatic. The awkwardness of this (even if the
tuo is enclitic) would be removed by reading Id pro' tuo capite qutid
dedit (Bentley) or Id quo'd pro capite tu'o dedit (the natural order of
words).

213. I have written (with some hesitation) utique lena for the corrupt
uitilena. or utti (uti) lena of P. Scapha was not actually a ‘ lena ⁹, in
spite of what 1. 270 seems to say. To suppose that she was would
contradict the whole situation. She was a servant in the house of
Philolaches; ef. 193, 238.

217. Scan in senec- as -ύυ, cf. Cas. 240 senecta aetate (first foot).
The fact that the second syllable of senecta would bear the word accent
in prose (senecta) need not cause difficulty at the beginning of the
second colon of the verse. No emendation is at all plausible.

222. diui Bothe, sor di P. To read dei or dit (disyllabic‚ with the
ictus on the second syllable) would be to introduce a scansion for
which there is no certain parallel in Plautus, though there are many
passages in which the nom. plur. of deus may be scanned as two
syllables forming a resolved rise or fall, and some in which the first
syllable forms the sall and the second is elided (e. g. Poen. 859 dei
dmnes, Merc. 436 dei irgfelicent).—-It would be possible, however, to read
qui me <di>faciant, cf. Pers. 296.

22 3. For hiatus in diaeresis of the iambic septenarius see on 158.

226. The feminine capiendas is preserved by Βι alone, but it is
expressly supported by Nonius 202, 2 5—27 (where an epigram of Atta
is also quoted with the fem. sing. resoluta crine) 3 cf. Priscian V. p. 169,
1 1 and the British Museum MS. of Ovid, Met. 111. 421 (Ellis’ collation)
et dignas Baccho, dignas et Apolline crines. -

230. Hiatus at diaeresis; cf. on 158. So too 236, 241.

232. referre bene merenti Bentley, sor refert...i B, referenti CD.
Goetz-Schoell prefer Gruter's emendation rem ferenti, because os
Scapha’s reply in 235 (ista res).

234. bonis me Camerarius, for me bonis Ρ, except C which has me
faciam bonis (so Ussing).

237. principe Bentley, principium P.

238. Scan with ictus on the second syllable of apud, rather than on
his. Apu‘d me is a common though by no means universal accentuation
in Plautus. Scan decem as = υυ. his decem Bentley, for isdee B,
isdem CD2.

241. Ι have added eu before edepol (note that the name of the speaker
is omitted in B, which suggests some other possible defect at that place),
and have written eo sor the meaningless bo of Βι aud the dittography of
ioui or uiuo of CD. Schoell proposed probo sor the bo, and this would
also do ; but an antecedent for quod (242) is desirable. Bugge's bouem
is weak and involves dat. 4- accus. 4- abl. with sacrificare, which is
