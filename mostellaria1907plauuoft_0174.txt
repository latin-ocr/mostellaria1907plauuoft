that he has thrown away', ·tantum argenti resumes or repeats the id
quod.. .dedit; cf. 184

212. enicasso. Forms in ·sso (—ssz'm), -ssz's, -sszt from verbs of the
‚first conjugation are common in Plautus (in Terence they are rare), e. g.
liberasso 223, seruasse 228, curassis 526, occupassz‘s 1097, seruassit Cist.
742 ; 111 the second conjugation we have prohibessis Aul. 611, prohibessit
Pseud. 1 2. These formatioris must probably be regarded not as analogous
to forms from consonant stems like faxo, faxim, &c. (aorist subjunctives
or optatives) bnt as compounds of present participles with forms of the
verb sum (negassim = negans sim, negassis = negans sis, &c.) So Skutsch
explains the double ss. In meaning they do not differ from faxo, faxim,
&c. : both are equivalent (i) to subjunctives—in prohibitions (e. g. 1097,
526), in expressions of wish, in clauses depending on caue (e. g. 523,
808), occasionally in final ne clauses, and in sentences of the type of
ausim dicere; (ii) to futures or future perfects indicative—so above and
in 223 (aster ni), 228 (aster si).

213. utique lena ‘and like a lena', cf. Asin. 713 ut deo ‘ as to a
god '. See critical note.

215. ne suadeas, probably a prohibition (cf. on ne with present
subjunctive, 74): in cases like this, however, it is often difficult to
distinguish between the prohibition and the final clause, cf. 613, 628,
1005,1023; 812 13 clearly final. (A comma might be put at ²14· )

1111110113 pendam, ‘think less of’‚ i. e. less than I do.

216. facito cogites, ‘mind you consider‘ , parataxis of the subjunc-
tive. Parataxis⁸may m such cases be defined as subordznalion without
α ετιόονιίιᾘπαίιφζξ word (e. g. ut)· . cf. on 146. The word which is
grammatically subordinate is often the more important in meaning.

inseruibis = z'nseruies. These old forms of the future indic. of the
fourth conjugation are common in Plautus and Terence, side by side
with the ordinary forms3 ef. scibo 997 (scies 434, sciet 98 5).—Note the
accus. with inseruire, as in 190.

217. aetatula, ‘ pretty age ', ‘ youth ' ; cf. Rud. 894 and on 196.

218. anginam, ‘ quinsy’; cf. Trin. 540. The long ι’ heard in the
medical term ⁶ angina pectoris’ is not antique, as is shown by Lucilius
1093 (Marx): insperato abiit, quem una augi‘na sustulit Ιιονα.

220. gratum ut inpetraui‚ ‘ now that I have got what pleases me' ς
gratum is used, like so many other neuter adjectives in Plautus and also
in classical Latin, as a noun ; cf. inhumanum, ‘ inhumanity' Rud. 767,
iniquom ibid. 1096, impudenti, ‘shamelessness' ibid. 620, melius ‘a
better thing ' ibid. 675, dulce amarumque Pseud. 63, cf. Cist. 70, uetus
Pseud. 436, illud ,festiuonu ‘ that merriment ’ Poen. 695, &c. It is
difficult to draw any hard and fast line between the ordinary and the less
ordinary usages of this kind. Examples like the following are quite
common in classical Latin : gratum elocuta Hor. Od. ΙΙΙ. 3. 17,
pergratum facere Cic. Lael. 4. 16; utile dulci, ridiculum acri, molle
atque facetum Hor. A. P. 343, Sat. I. 10. 14, 44, metu iniusti Sat. Ι. 3.
11 1 ; whereas iusque piumque (‘ your right and your dutifulness’) ovid
A. A. 1. 200 strikes one as peculiar. It is tempting to take animum
