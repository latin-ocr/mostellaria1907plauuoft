156 MOSTELLARIA [408-469

an oath administered (Rud. 1338), but also to cases in which the actor
ceases to speak in his proper tole and turns to address the audience.
Line 407 is part of the conversation between Tranio and Philolaches;
408-409, which is a hit at Philolaches, is intended for the ears of the
audience only, to whom Tranio proceeds to expound his plan of
campaign (410—418=‘y0u shall see, ladies and gentlemen, how I get
out of the difficulty '; cf. Bottom in Shaks. Mid. N. Dr. V. i. 187 ‘You
shall see, it will sall pat as Ι told you ’). We have an exactly parallel
case in Amph. 1006, where Mercury breaks off his speech to address
the audience in a familiar style (‘if you, ladies and gentlemen, will
kindly lend me your ears'‚ &c.).—The assumption of Ritschl that
408-409 begins a new scene, and that some lines have been lost which
would have explained the construction of the dative Homini, is there-
fore unnecessary. The space of one line left vacant in the MSS.
after 407 may be simply a means of indicating to the eye the com-
mencement of the new metre, as Ritschl himself admitted: indeed,
as Philolaches and his party leave the stage at this point, the iambics
do in a sense begin a new scene. [class. Rev. XX. p. 439.]

Tranio's question, shows tlze key without answering in words; but this
is scarcely in Plautus’ manner: besides iamiam is unintelligible unless
a lacuna is assumed.

the line which Goetz-Schoell suppose to have been lost before
