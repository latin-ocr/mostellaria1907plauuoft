PREFACE

THE present edition of the flloslellarz‘a has been entirely

Thus I have not hesitated to emend and accept emendations
in many corrupt places where the Edz'lzb ‚Minor contents

In regard to metre and prosody I have deliberately avoided
in this edition the discussion of vexed questions on which
Plautine scholars are divided in opinion. My own views as
