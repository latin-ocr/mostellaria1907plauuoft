138 ’ MOSTELLARIA [1040-1051

eludificor should be added to Lewis and Short.

1041-63. Monologue 01 Tranio, who enters from the angzportum.

1041. 11011 nauci esse=nilzili esse. Cf. Truc. 611 amas hominem
non nauci, Bacch. 1102 seruam non nauci, fragment of Parasitus Piger
ambo sumus non nauci, Cic. de Div. I. 58, 132 non habeo nauci lilarsum
augurem.

1042. The derivation of the word naucum was no doubt a matter of
speculation even in the time 01 Plautus (cf. Festus, p. 166 M.); possibly
it is connected with nugae, as Ritschl thought. Schoell thinks that
when Tranio says that he does not understand the word he means that
he does not understand the thing, i. e. that he is not good 101 nothing.
But nauci does not mean good 101 nothing; that is non nauci (‘ not
worth a straw ').

1043—44. nam : i. 0. ‘ I myself know how to behave in rebus dubiis;
sor', &c. ; cf. on 133. Line 1042 is, 01 course, parenthetical.

For accersere 01. 1093 and on Rud. 1056.

1045. illac, ‘down there’‚ pointing to the angiportum which was
a side street leading between the houses of Theoropides and of Simo to
the gardens at the back ; 01. on 931 f.

1046. ostium quod: by attraction 101 ostii quod, as 011011 111 Plautus;
so (with antecedent repeated after relative clause) 2 50.

angiporto (so A) : abl. of angiportum, n.‚ 2nd decl., which is the
ordinary form 01 1110 word in Plautus (except Cist. 124 P) as in Classical
Latin : ef. the plural forms angiporta Cist. 384, Pseud. 1235, angiportis
Pers. 444.

1050. quoniam: here with its original temporal meaning, as often in
Plautus (though not in Terencel, c.g. Asin. 350, 711, Mil. 129; it is
derived from quom iam (cf. ἐπειδὴ) as nunciam 110111 nunc iam, etiam
lrom ct iam.

atque, ‘sorthwith’, or ‘lo and behold ‘, introducing the principal
clause; 01. Bacch. 278 f. sorte ut adsedi in stega, atque ego lembum
conspicor, Epid. 2 17, Poen. 650 f. This seems to be a ‘ vulgar ' idiom,
used only by slaves and common persons 111 Plautus. It must be
distinguished from that of 488, where atque connects two coordinate
clauses.

me ex senatu segregant: i. e. resuse to allow me a voice in the
deliberations ; cf. on 688. Philolaches and his friends have determined
to make a clean breast of the matter; so Tranio will save his own skin
by a new ruse ; cf. 1060-61.

1051. uideo: an historical present, accompanied by the same tense in

the principal clause; see latter part 01 1110 11010 011 postquam sum, 156.
me uenire: lit. ‘that I was being sold', i. e. that I was being
‘given away’: this metaphorical phrase, which may be the source 01
1110 English phrases ‘ sold again ! ’, ‘what a selll'2&e., is fully explained
by Bacch. 814 ff. as derived from the sale of slaves by auction :
CH. Ο stulte, stulte, nescis nunc uenire te, atque in eopse adstas lapide,
ut praeco praedicat (‘ as the auctioneer says '). Nl. Responde: quis me
uendit .-⁹ To be put up 101 sale to the highest bidder is thus equivalent
