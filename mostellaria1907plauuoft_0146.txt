60 MOSTELLARIA [PERsoNAE

Most of the names of characters in this play are signficant names
(‘redende Namen', lit. speaking names, Lessing), i.e. names which
suggest a type of character, like ‘ Malaprop’, ‘ Absolute ' in Sheridan‚
or ⁶ F acing—both—ways', διο. in the Pilgy‘z‘m's Progress. But some of
them are merely conventional symbols for centain rffles, e. g. Simo for
an old man, especially one who is cheated of his money (cf. Hor. A.P.
2 8).

3¹1¹ranio is a correctly formed Greek name (Θρανίων), though one
which is not actually found in Greek3 see Bergk, Opusc. I. 208. Its
meaning may be ‘servus remigis ministerio functus’ (so Bergk), or it
may be formed (as Schmidt suggests, Hermes, vol. 37, p. 369) from
θρᾶνος in the sense of ‘tanner's bench ’, a sense which appears in the
verb θρανεύω; cf. Aristoph. Eq. 369 ἡ βύρσα σου θρανευσεται, ‘ your
hide shall be tanned’, i. e. you shall be flogged. ⁶ Tanner', with a .
latent suggestion of a passive meaning, would be a snitable name for
a slave, especially one of the character of Tranio. Ritschl derived the
name from τρανὴς or τρανός, ‘keen·xvitted ⁷ ; on which Fay in American
sournal of Philology, XXIV. 3. p. 2 50 ff. bases further suggestions.
Ussing drew attention to line 1115 Ne faxis .· nam elixus esse quam
assus soleo suauz'or and hinted that Tranio may be derived from the
name of some fish: Lorenz quoted also 1070 ll'on ego illi extemplo
hamum ostendam, sensim mittam lineam, and suggests θρανίς, θρανὶας,
⁴ sword-fish ' as the Greek original. For the by-form T ram'us see 560.

Grumio is probably a masculine form of the name Γρυμαία or
Γρυμέα, which is found in the catalogue of hetairae in Athenaeus, XIII.
583 e, and which properly denotes ‘ bag ', ‘ pocket ', ‘ purse'. See
Schmidt (loc. cit.) and Ritschl, Opusc. 111. 307. On Shakespeare's
adoption of the names Tranio and Grumio in his Tamz‘ng of the Shrew
see Intr. p. xvi.

Philolaches (φίλος, λάχος ‘lot ³), is a suitable name for one who
stakes his fortunes on a hazard, or treats life as a game of chance:
‘ Haphazard’. Compare the compounds φιλόκυβος, φιλοπότης, φιλο-
θύτης, φιλόξενος, φιληλιαστής in Aristoph. Vesp. 75, 79, 82, 88. The
name Φιλόκληρος appears in an inscription of Tanagra (Schmidt, loc.
cit.). Gen. either Philolachetis or Philolachisor Philolache (-ei, 374).

Philematium (φιλημάτων, cf. meum saulum as a term of endear·

ment in Poen. 366), ‘ Kissy ', a common name in later Greek literature3
cf. Lucian, Mer. Dial. XI. 2. Note that diminutive names of females
in -ium are feminine: see on l. ²53·

Scapha, the name of the aged attendant on Philematium, is probably
intended to suggest ¹ Cup ’—a sense which the diminutive form σκάφιον
has in Athenaeus (IV. 142 d, XI. 475 cl and in Plaut. Bacch. 70, Stich.
693, in both of which passages scaphium is associated with cantharus.
There is, therefore, an allusion to the drinking propensities of this old
woman ; cf. line 2 38 nam neque edes neque bibes, &c. The name
Canthara in Epid. 567 has a similar origin. Plautus is fond of repre-
senting old women as drunkards, e. g. Leaena in the Curculio. (Schmidt,
loc. cit.) As to the τὸΙε of Scapha see critical note on 213.
