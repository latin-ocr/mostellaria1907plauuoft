86 MOSTELLARIA [185-196

amet, the tense being determined by adiurasd, as Ussing says. Ellis
trans. ‘ What oath is that you swore—As truly as I should love her? '
comparing Hor. Sat. 11. 2, 124 ac uenerata Ceres, ita culmo surgeret
alto, the adjusted form of ita culmo surgas alto.

184. ‘istaec me '=ita istaec me amaret. ‘ What about she me
(=what about her loving me), why was not that added?'—the id
referring to the phrase istaec me. The meaning would have been clearer
if Plautus had written Ita istaec me, without the quid.

infecta, &c., ‘ 1 revoke my presents '.

185. dono, a predicated dative, as in dono dare, &c.

186. doctam, ‘ clever‘.

187. stultam stulte, ‘ in such a silly silly way '. The effect of the
combination is that the adj. and adv. mutually strengthen one another:
but the total effect is adverbial‚ as in Rud. 426 bellam belle tangere, ‘ to
give a sweet sweet embrace' and Cure. 521 sequere istum bella belle,
‘ follow him, like a good good girl '‚ cf. Asin. 676. So in Greek κακὸς
κακῶς Aristoph. Clouds 554, καλὴ καλῶς Acharn. 2 53, σοφὸς σοφῶς Eur.
Bacch. 1 189, περισσὸν . . . περισσῶς ibid. 1197. In Cas. 854 z' belle bellia-
tula we have the opposite order of adv. and adj. So in Spenser (quoted
by Munro on Lucr. 111. 898), ‘Poorly‚ poor man, he lived; poorly,
poor man, he died ’.

quin mone P ‘ why not correct me? ’ Cf. on 172.

188. exspectes, ‘look to ⁹, ‘ are at the beck of'‚ ‘ wait upon ' (as in
Shakcspeare’s ‘ letting ·‘ I dare not ” wait upon “ 1 would '' ').

189. morem praecipue geras, ‘ show special favour '.

sic, ‘ as you do ’; cf. Rud. 426.

190. merctricium‚ an adjective (nent. sing), cf. Bacch. 40 and

carmcficz'us 5 5. mm meretricium, ‘ not like a mistress ’-
unum : sor the accus. aster inseruire cf. 216 and Poen. 927.

191. nam quod, ⁴ Why what ‘3 cf. Aul. 42, 44, Asin. 41, Verg.
Georg. IV. 445 Nam quis te, iuuenum corfidenffssime, nostras Iussit
adire domos ? 'Wagner and Lorenz regard nam quis as exactly=
quisnam, but this is not certain. Cf. note on 258.

uorsatur. The verb uersari in Plautus is, as Langen remarks,
never used in the later sense of ‘to be engaged with (upon) ': it has
always a strictly local sense ; here, ‘to take up one's abode ⁹, ‘to
nestle '. Conversely uorti is used for the classical uersarz'3 cf. 639.

illud, with a gesture ‘ yonder': cf. Amph. 543 lucescit lzoc iam,
where hoc eorresponds to the gesture of pointing to the sky.

192. pessumis exemplis, so 2123 cf. notes on 54, 1040. Phrases
formed with exemplis and modis are nearly equiv. to emphatic adverbs:
miris modis ‘strangely’‚ ‘in wondrous wise', z'ndzgnis modis (1033)
‘ shamefully ’3 pessumis exemplis interf. ‘ to put to a horrible death '.

194. male praecipere, ‘to give bad adviee’.

196. aetate et satietate. Note the jingle : ‘ age and surfeitage ’,
‘ when you are older and he is colder '. Scapha is probably only taking
a prudent view of the situation ε she knows that Philolaches is squander-
ing his substance and will eventually be unable to support Philematium.
