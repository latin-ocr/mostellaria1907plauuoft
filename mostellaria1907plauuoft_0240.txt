152 MOSTELLARIA [241-284

unexampled in Plautus; Lindsay's bono is hardly Plautine. In any case
there is hiatus at the diaeresis; cf. on 158.—-The hiatus between eu and
Edepol is found in all the passages in which the two appear together.

243. uideas Schoell, for ut uideas P.

246. After this verse the MSS. have (247) Is acceptum sat habes
tibi fore illum amicum sempiternum, which Acidalius and most
edd. have expelled as a mere repetition of 224. Is it possible that we
have here a case <somewhat different from that mentioned on l. 816) in
which a verse has been repeated in a slightly changed form to serve
stage purposes? Line ²45 would fit on quite well to 22 3 ; possibly the
intention of the stage copy was that 224-244 should be omitted in acting
(the scene is intolerably long), but that 224 should be introduced after
246 in a form adapted to its new context.

248. The assentatio begins (cf. adsentabor 246) and the metre changes
to trochaic septenarii.

²49- adueniat Ritschl, for ueniat P.

25²· nequiquam (P), not nequicquam or nequidquam, is the spelling
of the Ambrosian in other passages of Plautus and of the best MSS. in
most passages of other authors, see Wolfflin‚ Archiv 2, 5 and 89. For
the -quz'-‚ cf. explanatory note on quz‘58 z nequiquam =lit. ‘ no how’.

254. Ι have been guided partly by Nonius 198, 20, who quotes the
line in the sorm uide, capillum satin conpositum sit conmode, instead of
uiden capillus satis compositust commode P. The passage in
Nonius is curious; he wants to show that there is a neuter noun capillum,
side by side with capillus masc. But he seems not to have noticed that
if his reading satin (interrogative) is right capillum cannot be the subject
of the question; for satin must stand at the beginning of it, whether
independent or dependent (as in 166, 282, 1109). There is therefore no
need to regard capillum as neuter.

258. opus B, opust CD. The ictus on the nam at the end of the
question is peculiar ; see passages quoted in explanatory note.

2 59. Hiatus after opera ζ 2nd rise of trochaic Septenarius): see Pref. p. vi.

260. euge P is spelled eugae six times out of eleven in A. The second
syllable is long in all the passages which show the metre.

261. inscita's Miiller.

264. lez‘nnm, not mili‘num as Lewis and Short (following Ritschl’s
mHt'numue) say.

²78· Ι adhere to my emendation nimis male, for nimale B, ni male
CD. Camerarius (followed by some modern editors) read ut male, with
hiatus after unum; Ritschl male ut. But see passages quoted in
explanatory note.

280. So Seyffert sor illud est maximam (Ἧι-Π) P, illuc esse maxima
Gellius.

281. merua-met: so subegb‘runt Bacch. 928, ῖοεατιένιιηί Pers. 160, at
ends of lines. Cf. tulzrunt, sletbrunt in classical verse (Verg. Ecl. IV. 61 ,
Aen. II. 774, 111. 48, Sec).

282. me supplied by Camerarius.

284, 285. Schoell substitutes sibi for tibi P ; but sibi placere is incon-
