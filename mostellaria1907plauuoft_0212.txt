126 MOSTELLARIA [815-828

way: datin soleas atque me intro ducite ἓ ‘ will you give me my shoes
and show me in?' the latter clause being also an interrogative com-
mand. No doubt there are instances in which a copulative conjunction
unites a command and a statement, e. g. Most. 1039, Rud. 359, 519,
Pseud. 277 f. audio atque . . . confir3 bnt it is difficult to quote an instance
in which a command is so coupled with a question.

816. factum edepol uolo, i. e. ‘ you are quite welcome ’.

817. uestibulum et ambulacrum, probably two words sor the same
thing, a space in front of the house, large enough to take a walk in3
cs. ante aedes, Varro L. L. VII. 81 uestibulum, quod est ante domum.

818-827. This passage is full of ¹ double cntente’, as Strong and
Fay have pointed out: a gesture of Tranio makes it clear that by postis
he is referring to the >two old men.

820. non uideor, cf. on 197.

821. eo pretio, &c., ‘ I once paid a fine price sor them’ ; eo
(emphatic) i. e. ut pulchrae essent, ‘ a suitable price'.

‘fuerant’. Simo's empti fuerant was merely meant as an equiv.
of empti sunt (cf. 519 appellaueras=appellauisti, 822 emeras=emisti,
487 oblitus ficeram=oblitus sum, Aul. 627 quod apstuleras=quod
apstulisti, ibid. 672, 759, Amph. 383 peccaueram = peccaui, Asin. 715,
Stich. 251 ; cf. too on Most. 694) ; but Tranio seizes on the word
fuerant, as if Simo had meant that the house had been his, but was so no
longer.

823. tris minas, a humorous exaggeration.

uectura, ‘ carriage’, ‘ freight ‘, cf. Asin. 432.

824. qui, an old asseverative particle (originally=‘ somehow ‘‚ abl. of
the indefinite quis, quid ) often joined to hercle, as here, Trin. 464 hercle
qui dicam tamen, Men. 428 hercle qui tu recte dicis: similarly we have
ut qui e. g. Capt. 553, quippe qui Aul. 348, ecastor qui Asin. 930, pol
qui ibid. 823, edepol qui Mil. 779.

826. intempestiuos, ‘out of season‘: cf. Plin. H. N. XVI. 39, 189
robur uere caesum teredinem (=tarmitem) sentit; bruma autem neque
uitiatur neque pandatur, Isidorus Orig. XII. 5, 10 Ita (i.e. termites)
apud Latinos ligni uermes vocantur, quos tempore importuno caesae
arbores gignunt (=Servius on Georg. 1. 256).

id uitium, &c., ‘that 's the only thing that is the matter with
them '. The idea of ‘ only ‘ is understood, as so osten in Latin.

827. sunt inducti, a loose use of the perfect sor the future perf.

828. enim. See note on 551. This is one of the few passages in
Plautus in which enim approaches very nearly to the meaning of ‘ for’ ;
cf. 926, Capt. 860, Truc. 908, Poen. 286, 604: Clement in American
Journ. ofPlzil. XVIII. 4 adds Pers. 62, Pseud. 137, Rud. 922, Trin. 586.

puniremus, ‘ porridge-eating', a humorons hybrid, like pergraphi-
cus Trin. 1 139, semisonarius Aul. 516, subbasilicanus Capt. 815.

barbarus, ‘from foreign parts ’‚ just as the Chinese nowadays
speak of Europeans as ‘ barbarians' (e. g. ‘ the barbarian Eye ’, see
Liddell and Scott under ὀφθαλμός). In this passage barbarus probably
denotes Roman, as so often in Plautus, cf. Trin. Prol. 19 Plautus uortit
