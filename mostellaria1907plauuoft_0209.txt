consss’ue quam liquida tempestas (liquida) esse solet ‘ as fine weather

764. Architects in sunny lands build their houses iu such a way as to
secure as much opportunity of shade as possible.

765. sub sudo columine seems to mean ‘ under a cloudless sky ’—
nearly the same as Vergil’s mulo sub aetheris axe (Aen. 11. 512).
-Columen is simply the older form of culmen, which means ‘ the eope of
the sky ' in sub culmine Cic. Aratea 260; cf. the use of uertex ibid. 24,

775-783. Monologue of Tranio, as he crosses the stage in order to
find Theoropides. Agathocles of Syracuse was a very conspicuous figure
in his time, as is shown by his coins, on which he stamped his own
head (an unusual practice at that time) and the title ΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΣ, i. e.
King of Sicily. His greatness was also attested by Scipio Africanus,
who in reply to the question who were, in his opinion, the bravest
warriors and at the same time the wisest statesmen, replied ‘ Agathocles
and Dionysius’ (Polybius, XV. 35). This passage also contains evidence

on the date of production of the Greek original of the Mostellaria (the

Φάσμα), which can hardly have appeared earlier than the year 289 Β. C.,
the date of the death of Agathocles. Compare Intr. p. ix, and‘cffiTrssp.
