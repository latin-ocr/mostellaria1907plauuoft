100 MOSTELLARIA [347-357

347. tu, is said to one of the slaves in attendance.

aff‘netphio, ⁴ beginning with Delphium ', as the visitor.

348. Enter Tranio as seruos currens, in hot haste from the harbour (i.e.
by the stage-door to the left of the spectators). Having gone to the
Piraeus to buy fish (67) he has happened to see his old master, just
¹returned from abroad. Tranio takes his stand in the front of the stage
with his back to the drinking party, and addresses the audience (348-

62 .
3 >summis opibus atque industriis, ‘ with all his might and
main ' : for opibus cf. Merc. 1 1 1 ex summis opibus uiribusque experiri,
Stich. 45, Cic. Tusc. ΙΙΙ. 11. 2 5 omnibus uiribus atque opibus repugnare ,-
in Plaut. the sing. ops is only used in the sense of ‘help ’. The plur.
industriis is prob. determined by opibus.

349. perisse, stronger than perire, ‘ to be a dead man '.

350. stabulumst confidentiae, ‘can assurance find a home'; cf.
Capt. 5 23 nec confidentiae usquam hospitiumst nec deuorticulum dolis.

3 51. A proverbial expression, cf. Capt. 529 neque iam Salus
seruare, si uolt, me potest, Ter. Ad. 761 f., Cic. ΙΙ. Verr. 111. 57. 131,

ro Font. 6. 21.
p si cupiat, potest, a common form of conditional sentence in
Plautus and also in classical Latin: ‘ nor can Salvation herself be
salvation to us, should she desire to do so '. A list of the Plautiae
examples with possum in the principal clause is given in my note on
Rud. 566 3 sor other verbs see on Rnd. 1021.

3 5²· mali maeroris montem maxumum, ⁴ mighty mountain of
monstrous misery ' ; cf. 61. For mali=uelzementis (adj. of cognate
meaning), cf. on 316. fllalus maeror occurs, according to the MSS„ in
Aul. 279 ; but in both these passages Leo takes malum as a noun(

ad portum, ‘ by the harbour ; cs. ad forum ‘ at (ον in) the market·
lace ⁹, 9.
p 354. 1930ri facere is like conpendi facere 60 ‘to earn ’‚ ‘ to clear ¹.

356. plagipatidae, ‘ sons of the whip’‚ again Capt. 472, where see
note.

357. uel, ‘ or rather' (see on ²99· iv), since 356 seemed to point to
slaves; here the reference is to Greek memenaries, who at the date of
the νέα κωμῳδία (circa B.C. 340-260) had replaced the citizen armies to
a large extent, as Isokrates often complains

nummum is the regular gen. pl. in Plautus; e.g. Trin. 152. For
the sense of nummus see on Most. 115 (2); the tres nummi of the
T rinummus stand for any small sum. The pay of a common Greek
mercenary in the 4th century B.c. was 20 silver drachmae per mouth,
i.e. ξ of a drachma, or 4 obols, per day (=about fid. of our money).
Α corresponding English expression would be ‘men who will take
a masked battery for rs. a day ’. [There is probably no reference to
the daily pay of the Roman legionary, which was only 3 (and ἦ) asses at
the time of Polybius]

fala, a high wooden tower, from which the missiles called salaricae
were rown.
