xviii INTRODUCTION

half of the action, and this is simply a reproduction of the
Mostellaria: Tranio is represented by the serving-man
Rezgrnald, Grumio by Rom, Philolaches by Lz'onell, Theo-
ropides by Old Lz'onell, Callidamates by Rioter, Simo by

fllasler Rz'cott, Philematium by Blanda3 Scapha is the name
of the old servant woman in both plays. This by-plot
stands in a very loose connexion with the main plot, which
appears to have been considered by the author as too thin to
form a play by itself.¹ Another play in which the Mostellaria
occupies a similar position is Le Come'dz'en Poble by Mont-
fleury (1674); here the play of Plautus forms the first Act,
which is almost entirely disconnected with the rest of the
play. There are many other modern plays which are said
by some writers to be based to a greater or less extent on
the Mostellaria3 for example T he Drummer or T he Haunled
House by Addison3 but the main lines of the plot are so
different that the connexion is doubtful. The Arz'odosz‘o by
Lorenzino de' Medici (1549) owes something to the Mostel-
laria in one scene ; but it is in the main based upon the
Aulularia of Plautus, with reminiscences from other plays;

¹ Heywood no doubt agreed with the principle subsequently enun-
ciated by Fielding: ‘ The ancients may be considered as a rich common,
whereon every person who hath the smallest tenement in Parnassus has
the right to fatten his muse. Nor shall I ever scruple to take to myself
any passage which 1 shall find in any ancient author to my purpose
without setting down tlte nanze of the author from whom z't was taken '
(quoted by Professor Paul Shorey in his address on the ‘Relations of
Classical Literature to other branches of learning' at the Congress of
Arts and Science, St. Louis, 1904, vol. iii, p. 3843 the italics are mine).
In his Captives (licensed 1624, first printed by Mr. A. H. Bullen in
his Collection of Old English Plays, vol. iv, 1885) Heywood has taken
the main plot from the Rudens of Plautus and the by-plot <according
to Mr. J. A. Symonds, in a letter to the Academy‚ dated Dec. 7, 1885)
from Masuccio's Novellino.
