EXCURSUS

On the Moods emplqyed in Questions as to what is to be done.

IN my notes on Most. 368, 371, 392 I have made no attempt to
distinguish quid ago? from quid agam :⁹ or from similar questions in
which the Future Indicative is used. The latest investigation of this
point is contained in Dr. H . Sjogren's Zum Gebrauclz des Futurums
im Altlateinz'sclzen (Uppsala, 1906), a work which I had not read
until after the whole of my commentary to the present edition was
written and printed, but to which I have referred in some passages of
my critical notes. Sjbgren’s results are based on a careful study of all
previous work bearing on the subject, and he distinguishes (pp. 81 ff.)
questions in the first person as to what ‘is to be done’ with the
indicative, like quid ago ?, from those with the subjunctive; and these
latter ¹ he again distinguishes on the lines of Μοιτίε2 according as the
subjunctive is (i) accompanied by ego or nunc or both ego and nunc, or
(ii) not so accompanied. To questions of the type quid ego agam ?,
quid ego nunc agam .-⁹, quid nunc agam? (e. g. Most. 378, 662, Amph.
1046) he concedes the name ‘deliberative ', as expressing perplexity,
despair, &c.‚ mainly in monologue; questions like quid agam ,9 (e.g.
Mil. 363, Aul. 651) he describes as ‘ questions for information as to the
wish or will of another' (Auskunflffragen): questions like quid ago?
(e. g. Pers. 666, Men. 176) he calls‘ consultative questions ⁹, i. e. questions
for information as to the views or opinions of another-the questioner
asking in a calm tone how he ought to act under the particular circum-
stances. F urther‚ he marks off as a special group the questions com·
monly called ‘ angry questions' like solus cenabo domi .-⁹ (Stich. 599).
The last three classes usually appear in dialogue. In the light of
these results Sjogren rejects the emendation quid ego ago? Most. 368,
where he would adhere to quid ego agam :⁹ (MSS.).³ I believe that these
distinctions are on the whole well-founded in Plautine usage3 but

¹ So far as relates to agere, and partly to facere. Sjogren recognizes
that other verbs do not require the addition of ego or nuncto form a
‘ deliberative ' question, e. g. quid machiner? Capt. 531.

² On Principles and Methods in Latin Syntax‚ p. 210 (New York,
19i’31'l'he nam he would connect with Tranio's reply, quoting (in support
of nam quid tu, malum) Amph. 592, Rud. 945, which he considers
sufficiently parallel, though the nam does not in those instances precede
the quid, malum.
