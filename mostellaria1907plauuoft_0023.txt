INTRODUCTION xix

on this play was founded Les Esprz‘ts by Pierre Larivey
(¹579)-
THE TExT.

The principal MSS. containing the Mostellaria, or parts of
it, are :—

(i) The Ambrosian palimpsest (Α), a MS. of the fourth or
perhaps even of the third century A.D.-—one of the oldest
MSS. of a Latin author in existence. But only parts of it
are extant; of this play we have 354 lines, viz. 576-613‚
630, 631, 632, 653—723, 759-796, 826—858, 891-1026
(44 lines), 1042-1073.

(ii) The three ‘Palatine' MSS. (B, C, D), dating from
about the eleventh century ΑΛ).

(iii) The ‘Codex Lipsiensis’ (F), a MS. of the fifteenth
century, and of no authority compared with that of the other
MSS. referred to above.

Besides these MSS. we have occasional quotations of
passages by grammarians and other scholars, which, being
based on some ancient authority, sometimes throw light on
the readings of MSS. which have been lost.

The first printed edition (the ‘editio princeps ') was pub-
lished at Venice, 1472.

The textual notes at the end of this edition do not form
an apparatus criticus3 they are limited to cases in which
there is divergence of opinion among recent editors as to
the true reading. But all readings for which the present
editor is responsible are accompanied by a note. Readings
of the Palatine MSS. are here given in black type and
accompanied by the symbol P, minor discrepancies between
B, C, and D being as a rule disregarded. The symbol P
thus points to the readings of the arche—type of BCD—-a MS.
