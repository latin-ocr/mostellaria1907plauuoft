469-545] CRITICAL NoTEs 157

(givtgn inlmy ex)planatory note) would be obviatcd by reading after 466

[or‚ quin ez' a‘ttzgrant ἓ]
Tangere (468) is the reading of C ; it would be an infinitive of indignant
question or exclamation, often found in Plautus: ‘ you touch it a1s0?'
i. e. to think of you (the attendant slaves) wanting to touch it also (as
your master has done)! Quoque etiam (469) is a common Plautine
periphrasis for ‘also ', cf. Amph. 30, 81, 281, 717, 753, &c. Et heus
(467) ‘ and, I say! ' would connect itself with 461 ς cf. Bacch. 327. The
end of 469 (quin eloquere P) is obviously corrupt: see Ritschl, who
thought that it came from 472, and Goetz-Schoell ; for the construction
of quin ei attzssgant? see explanatory note ou 614 (quin stram Β). My
reading has the advantage of not requiriug the assumption of a lacuna ;
and it renders the text intelligible at three obscure points (terram—
uo ue— uta .
q ,ὅ 5. qgid ζεῦ ‚⁹ (before non intellego) P, omitted by Camerarius.
Capitcile scelus factzimst. T H. quid est? non intellego Goctz·Sch0ell
(without caesura) ; ‘certa ratione vix emendabilis ’.
478. sceleris Bentley, for sceleste P.
481. Scan ez· as in 947, 986.
484. Hiatus at the caesura, justified also by the pause.
495. Theoropides (T lzeuropz'des) supplied by Ritschl : lacuna in P.
496. somnis mortuos supplied by Schoell: lacuna in P.
498. Hiatus at pause after the second sall.
501. me lzic Guyet‚ for hic me P ; hic me necuit Bentley (cf. Ennius
Ann. 559 V., but cf. Most. 479, 481, Asin. 921).
504. Scan scelestae hal as standing for uta—¹ (1st f00t3 cf. on 217).
508. hict'n Leo, for hicine P ; for the ictus on the second syllable of
a tribrach word is very rare, even in the first foot of a line. So itdn
Mil. 1120. See also on 1100 below.

(possibly a way of indicating the length of the first syllable, see on 499),
e. g. Trin. 525 Acclzeruntis B.
513. fuge Scaliger (MS. note in his copy of ed. by Sambucus in the
Bodleian Library)‚ for fugies B, fuges CD, cf. 527.
517 f. Lacuna in P, supplied by Leo on the lines of Ritschl.
521. percussissent Acidalius, Goetz·Schoell ; but the second person of
the MSS. suits the context better, and is grammatically unobjectionable.
Α 527. ficge FZ, fui P, fugis 13², cf. 513.
528. So Bentley, for inuocabi (inuocabis 13²> and te P.
5²9· utibi hodie ut P, corrected to ut tibi hodie 13².
537, 538. Lacuna in B, supplied by Camerarius,
540. Hoc ne Bothe, sor Ne hoc P, which involves hiatus.
545. male supplied by N iemeyer.
