132 MOSTELLARIA [913-929

9¹3· talenta magnae cf. on 647.
istis, vaguely, for eis or illis, cf. 669. For similar vagueness of hic
cs. on 540. In 918, 919, 921 the same person is variously described as
iste, hic, ille; in 115 5 by is and ille.
917. subegi, sc.filz'um tuom.
faenore: cf. on 532.
918. isti, ‘the man who sold it '‚ cf. on 913.
arraboni: cf. on 648.
920. ita enimuero, ‘ let it be so '.
ne qua causa. supsiet, ‘that there may be no excuse sor demur in
the background ’.
921. uel, ‘or rather'; cf. on 299.
denumerauero: cf. on 526.

922. at enim ne . . . sit, lit. ‘but‚ look you, let there not be ’‚
equivalent to ‘ but perhaps there may be‘. The phrase can be explained
without the ellipsis of cauendum est or metu03 cf. Aul. 647 ne inter
tunicas habeas, Stich. 600 at ille ne suscenseat, Pers. 541, Rud. 775.
quid captionis, ‘some trap '; cf. Cic. pro Quinct. 16. 53 si in paruola
re captionis aliquid vererere. Plautus uses the word captio in five other
placeS, and always in the sense of ‘ trap'‚ ‘ quibble': 1144, Asin. 790,
Epid. 297, 701, Truc. 627. Lorenz and Ussing explain the dat. of the
MSS. (which might possibly be retained in the above sense) as =sraudi,
detrimento, a very rare sense (cf. Cic. Att. V. 4. 4, Gaius Dig. XXIX.
3. 7, Lex Rubr. col. 1, V. 45) and not so suitable to the present context
as ‘ trap ’.

9²3· ioculo modo, ‘ even by way of a joke’, ‘even in fun ', cf. Rud.
{129 occupito modo illis adferre uim ioculo pauxillulam, Stich. 23,

erc. 33.

925.9quja=‘ (you ought to do 5οῑ because'; cf. Men. 370, Mil. 1140.

postquam sum: cf. on 156.
926. enim: cf. on 828. Here=‘ (quite true) for '.
eam rni habeas, &c., ‘for that (eam, cf. on Rud. 906) you should
be grateful to me and my character '. This combination (ego atque
animus meus) is quite Plautine: Trin. 394 hoc unum consolatur me
atque animum meum. Compare such expressions as sese atque aetatem
suam Rud. 486, caput atque aetatem tuam ibid. 1346, 375. Mhi atque
animo meo is found also iu Sallust, Cat. 52. 8. The phrase as used by
Tranio is meant as a mere periphrasis of milzz’3 but Theoropides
interprets it humorously as though there were two persons against
whom he had to be on his guard. For the subjunct. cs. Epid. ²94
Epidico habeas gratiam.
928. sat sapio, ‘ I show my good sense ’.
aps te modo uno ι 1. e. as distinct from your animus.
tecum sentio ε an ironical asz'de.

929. rus. The statement that Philolaches is in the country has
nowhere been made in the text as we have it; perhaps, as Ussing says,
Theoropides is supposed to draw this inserence sor himself, believing,
as he does, that the town house has been sold.
