caedite, not ‘kil-l’, as Fore. thought, but probably ‘devour’z
similar verbs are sometimes used to describe the havoc made by a
hungry man among the eatables: e. g. Stich. 554 meum ‘ne ‘confr‘uizce'r‘tt
cibum. Goetz compares the word cibz'cicla ‘bread consumer’ (a de-
scription of a parasite used by Lucilius, '718 Marx, = σιτόκουρος), and
also Truc. 741 inimici mei bona istic caedent. The phrase caedere
saginam seems to have been current : it occurs at any rate in Symmachus
Epist. I. 7 Nan: comitibus uestris utpote sobriis caedundae saginae curiz
posterior est (‘ give less thought to gorging '), which passage m‘ay ho'w'-
ever be an imitation of Plaut.

682 faxo, in origin an aorist subjunctive, like the Greek πράξω, is equiva-
lent in meaning to a future or future perfect indicative 3 so ferare faxo
1133, Trin. 60, 62. Similar forms are capso Bacch. 712, Rud. 304,
respexis Most. 523, Rud. 678, &c.‚ faxim (aor. optat. like πράξαιμι)
Amph. 511, Aul. 420, &c.

adferat stands in parataxis to faxo, lit. ⁴ ἶ will see to it some one
shall bring ', equivalent in meaning to the hypotactic construction saxo
ut adserat, cf. Asin. 902. Similarly ferare faxo ‘ I will see to it you be
carried’ 1133 ; this construction survived into the classical period,
0. g. Yerg. Aen. IX. 154 haud saxo putent, ‘ I'll warrant they shall not

³ furcifer, ‘jail-bird’. The furca was a A-shaped piece of wo0d‚
to which the arms of the slave to be punished were bound, very much
in the same way as to the patibulum (cf. on 56), excepting that the
furca, while it involved disgrace, did not always involve torture. The
point of Tranio's question is seen by reference to 62 f. 3 he means, ‘What
objection can you have to that arrangement?' Grumio had disdained
to reply to so transparent an excuse3 but he is stung into a retort by
Tranio'ssurcifi’r.

70. istuc nomen, ‘that epithet of yours ', sc. furcifer.
