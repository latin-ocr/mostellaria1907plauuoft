1 10 MOSTELLARIA [sco-5 1 5

deInvent.1. 39. 71 qui nos per fideme fefellerunt, Cic. pro Caecina, 3. 7
qui per tutelam aut societatemfraudauit quertzpzssam In these phrases
per means ‘in violation of', like the ‘prffixe pejeratis (131631, Dict.
Etymol. Lat.) found in per· fidus, ‘contrary to fides’, per· -2urus or p?-
iums, ‘contrary to zus’ : cf. Greek παρά.

504. scelestae, ‘under a curse’ so again 532, 563, Rud. 502 quid
mihi scelesto tibi erat auscultatio? &c.: so in Capt. 762 scelus= infortu-
mum. This sense is peculiar to Plautus; cf. 170.

506 ff. A noise is heard within· , Philolaches and his guests are sup-
posed to be unaware of the conversation which is going on outside the
house (cf. 51 5), and they are talking in a noisy and injudicious fashion.
This inopportune episode Tranio cleverly turns to his advantage.

508. hicin perc. ‘ It was he (i.e. Theoropides) who knocked ! ' z cf.
516. This is spoken to the pretended ghost, and explains the alarm
of the old man ιιι the next line. The existence of an asseverative
enclitic particle -ηέ (ultimately identical with the interrogative -ne‘‚ but
entirely distinct from ne=vai‚ which is never enclitic) has been proved
by Minton Warren (American Journ. of Phil. ΙΙ. pp. 50—82). It is
attested by Priscian, who speaks of a ⁴ ne confirmatiua ’, and it is found
in the MSS. in a number of passages from which it has been violently
expelled by editors. Perhaps its most characteristic use is in answerS,
echoing a previous question, e. g. Trin. 634 LV. egone? LE. tune!
‘ I '?—Yes, you', Capt. 857, Epid. 575, Stich. 635 egone? tune ! mihine ?
tibine J, Pers. 220 ΡΑ Ε. z'tanest? SO. itanest !; so (probably) Most. 5803
but it is also found in sentences like Epid. 541 plane hicinest qui . . .
pepulit3 and in conditional clauses like Mil. 309 hocine si miles sciat,
936 at egone hoc si ffciam plane.

510. This and the next line are said aszde. illisce, ‘those fellows in
the house‘· this form of the nom. pl. of illic (formiis tce, οἷ’ 935, Men
997) is found only before a vowel or Ιι; similarly hisce (sor lzi- ce) in
Amph. 974, Capt. Prol. 35, Mil. 374‚1334, Pers. 856, Pseud. 539,

ς Rud. 294, Tria. 878.

511. nimis quam, ‘exceedingly’z cf. Capt. 102 nimis quam misere
cupio, and the phrases mimm quam, sane quam, mirum quantum,
ὑπερφυῶς ὡς, θαυμαστῶς ὡς. For nimis=‘ very much ’ , see on 278.

manufesto: cf. on 679.
hic, i.e. Theoropides.

51²· The suspicions of Theoropides are aroused and Tranio sees that
his only chance is to get rid of his master. His apscede ab ianua is said
with an affectation of extreme terror.

513. quo fugiam? is a question asked sor information or advice,

‘whither am I to run‘?', and is therefore‘ deliberative' only in this
sense.
etiam tu fuge,‘ run away yourself also'· , etiam with tu, cf. Persa 34.

515. Α voice calls from behind the door. Tranio, supposing that
T heoropides has heard it, and again equal to the occasion, uses a form
of reply (uttered iu a voice of terror) which gives the requisite hint to
