119-148] CRlTlCAL NOTES 149

119. Efficere Seyffert, for dicere P, which may, however, be defended.

121. Ei Gulielmius, for Et P.

123. I have written Atque for Et P, in order to make the line a
regular anapaestic dimeter. In anapaestic metre the falls of the feet
are always pure, i. e. dimoric (either υυ or ->.

125. After this line the MSS. have two probably spurious lines :—

Expoliunt docent litteras iura leges
Sumptu suo et labore.

129. Scan -miniclum eis as a proceleusmatic.—After legionem the
MSS. have comita, which is struck out by Seyffert and Spengel as a
gloss (i. e. comitem) on adminiclum.

131. I have written ubi unum sor unum ubi P, in order to make the
line scan. But possibly the whole is an interpolation.

133. Scan Nam e· without elision, as forming a disyllabic rise3 see
on 43 above.

137. If this line is a cretic tetrameter, the second rise of the second
cretic is disyllabic ζέἅ), and also the contiguous rise (rniln'), neither of
which resolutions is legitimate. Gz.-Sch. sean as a cretic dimeter
followed by a trochaic dimeter catalectic‚ with hiatus and syllaba
anceps at the diaeresis and mi sor milti-an uncertain form of verse :
see Spengel, RefimuvorschQge, p. 140. Spengel himself (p. 131)
. removes the difficulty by reading haec for ea.

After this line the MSS. have :—

Mi aduentu suo grandinem imbremque attulit
which Gz.—Sch. scan as a trochaic tripody catalectic followed by a
trochaic dimeter catalectic. But the line looks like an interpolation
(so Crain and Brix) ; for there ought to be no mention of hail and rain
till 142, when Amor (=imber, 1 1 13 is introduced ε Ignauia corresponds
to the tempestas (108‘. It is, however, possible that Plautus confused
his simile at this point.

141. εᾶ Seyffert, for eam P. The syllaba auceps is legitimate at the
diaeresis of the cretie tetrameter ; and the neut. plur. is grammatically
more correct, referring to uerecundiam et uirtutis modum (sem. -ε- masa).

14²· Ι have written pluit in corpus meum for in cor meum P,
which is clearly a repetition of the end of 143. My emendation is
suggested by 164 in pectus perpluit meum, which may well have had
something corresponding to it in 142.

145. usum Lambinus, for usu P : the accus. agrees better with 123.

146. I have written putescunt for putant P <putent B²); cf. Cure.
242 dum intestina exputescunt libi. The objections to putent, which
has been accepted by all editors since Camerarius, are (i) it is one
syllable too short : (ii) the verb putere elsewhere means ‘ to stink ’, not
to ‘ rot ’, though the adjective putidus is quoted by Nonius, p. 152, in
the sense ‘ rotten ' (nauis putida, paries putidus, &c., side by side with
nauis putrida).—Is it possible that the ενιῖ, which Pius says was written
in priscis exemplaribus after edepol, stands for -escunt (originally a
marginal correction relating to putent)?

148. I have written Quom for Quin cum P.
