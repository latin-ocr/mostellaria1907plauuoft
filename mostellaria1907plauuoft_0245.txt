376. te supplied by Ritschl aster edepol ; but see on 1093.

377. My emendation is based on the principle suggested by ll. 319, 325,
331. Callidamates is only half awake at this point, and his drnnken
stammer is quite in place. The et· before etiam is actually preserved
in one of the MSS. ·(C), contradicting by the u ay the rule of syllable
division commonly given in modern grammars: et· iam is however quite
according to the derivation of the word. 1 have supplied Iu before
mbe.

382. zterum supplied by Miiller. Or read E “ere autem lzz‘c with
Ritschl; cf. Mil. 207, Pers. 300.

tempus mzlzz‘ magu proprzum quam celeres, Cic. Sull. 3. 9. The com-
parative proprior is correctly formed on the same principle as inlustrior

sense and metre. —Propior would have to mean ‘a better support,
