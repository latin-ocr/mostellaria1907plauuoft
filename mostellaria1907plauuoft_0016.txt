xii INTRODUCTION

promises to wait until Tranio has spoken to the present
occupant, Simo, and leaves the stage.

In the interview with Simo that follows Tranio pretends
that his master wishes to inspect the house with a view to
imitating certain parts of it: he is himself, says Tranio,
about to build an additional wing to his own. Simo remarks,
ironically‚ that he mightphave chosen a better model, but
consents, and also promises not to breathe a syllable about
the misdemeanours of Philolaches. Tranio now summons
Theoropides. He informs him that Simo regrets the bargain
he has made, and begs him to say nothing about the purchase
out of consideration for his nezghbour’sfeelz'ngs. Thus primed
for the interview, the two old men are allowed to meet and
the inspection of the house takes place, without either of
them discovering that he is a puppet in Tranio’s hands.
The latter is all the while on the alert to twist any ambiguous
phrase into evidence that makes for his story of the purchase.
So far Tranio has been entirely successful: when his master
orders him to go to the country to fetch Philolaches, he
employs this, his first moment of leisure, to release the rioters
from the ‘state of siege’ (1048) by means of a back-gate
leading into the angiportum.

But the whole device is, after all, only a temporary
measure. Theoropides must ultimately discover that Simo
has not really sold his house. This truth Tranio recognizes
in 1054 :—

nam scio equidem nullo pacto iam esse posse haec clamgsenem.
The discovery has indeed been already made through an
untoward incident. According to a custom frequently
alluded to in the plays of Plautus, slaves called aduorsitores
(cf. on 313) come to fetch their master Callidamates from the
banquet, and knock loudly at the door of the house supposed
