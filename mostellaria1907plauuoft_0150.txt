not necessary. Still less is it necessary to suppose that Plaut. could use
loqui ut in the sense of loqui with the accus. and infin. (though in
Asin. 52 we have, in Leo’s opinion, an example of quod with subjunctive
= accus. with infin. z equidem scio iam filius quod amet meus).
frutex, ‘ trunk’,=‘ blockhead ’.
15. uero (lit. ‘really'), like ain ?, expresses astonishment, ‘Whats’
For its position third in the sentence ef. Aul. Prol. 18. ·
urbanus scurra, ‘ city lounger’, ‘ town-bred idler (loafer) '. The
word scurra, as used by Plaut„ is a term of wider application than
parasitus; it is defined in Trin. 202 urbani adsidui ciues quos.scurras
uocant3 it, therefore, corresponds to our phrase ‘ a man about town’;
cf. Epid. 15 f., where it is opposed to homo militaris.
deliciae popli (= populi), ‘ darling of the streets ’, ‘ favourite of the
canaille’, ef. Shakespeare‚ Othello 1. 2. 68 ‘the wealthy curled darlings γ
of our nation’: for populus=‘ the rabble ', ‘the populace‘‚ ‘the crowd
in the streets ', ‘the lower orders ’; cf. prostibulum popli Aul. 285, decus
popli Asin. 65 5, and Livy I. 17. 8, ΙΙ. 27. 5 and 12 consilio magis princi·
pum quam populi (almost = plebis) clamore. So Cic. pro Sestio 103, 104,
de Amic. 41 populum a senatu disiunctum. In Cure. 29 populus =‘ the
public ⁷, ‘the general'. For the form popli ef. Aul. 285, poplo Amph.
Prol. 101, 259, Rud. 1251, &c. ; similarly periclum (=periculum) Bacch.
962, Asin. 388, 903, uinclis <=uinculis) Capt. 766, Rud. 4763 contrast
discipulina for disciplina, 154.
16. mihi and tu are both emphatic.
hoc (abl.) . . . quod, ‘ for the reason that', cf 51 and Rud. 388 hoc
sese excruciat animi. quia, &c., Pseud. 822 s. hoc . . . quom, Rud. 1234

credo is parenthetical ; ‘ I think ⁹.
17. actutum, from actu, lit. ‘in the act', hence ‘ straightway’‚ ‘in no
long time' ; cf. 70 f.
tradier =tradi. Plautus frequently uses the present for the future
infinitive (here traditum iri) after the verbs dico, promitto, &c.; see
633, 1084, 1087, 1132, Asin. 366 dixit operam se dare, 377 promitto
hostire, 442 aibat reddere, 604 minatur sese abire, Cure. 597 nego me
dicere, Pers. 401 iuratus est se dare. Compare the use of the present
indicative (=‘ I will —’) referred to in the note on 261. But in some
of the above instanceS, e. g. scis te tmdier, the infin. denotes mere
futurity‚ not resolve : so too Rud. 589 aluam prodi sperauit.
in pistrinum tradier, ‘ to be put to work in the mill ’, i. e. in the
country. This form of labour, like that in the stone quatries (cf. Capt.
723-726), was considered almost to amount to torture.

tempestates = the seasons.
