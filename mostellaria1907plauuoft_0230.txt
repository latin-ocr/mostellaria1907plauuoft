142 MOSTELLARIA [1112—1132

radicitus. The word is quoted by Fronto (Epist. ad M. Antoninum de
Orat. p. 156) as ⁴ Πλαυτινότατον’. Perhaps translate the line ‘ No, not
merely to the root, but to the root of the root '.

11 13. numquam . . . hodie: cf. Rud. 612 n. h. quim· ad coniecturam
euadere, and on 657.

11 14. The same threat of buming or smoking out the refugee is
uttered by Labrax in Rud. 761.

1115. ne faxis, &Ga ‘Don't do that; for I generally taste better
boiled than roasted’. ⁷Ussing thinks that Tranio is punning on his
name (see on Personae) ; but perhaps it is only a way of saying ⁴ Why
not boil me instead of roasting me?' The threat of roasting at the
altar naturally suggests boiling. We have the same joke in Poen. 279,
where there is no pun on a name: Ml. Assum (i.e. Adsum) apud te
eccum. AG. At ego elixus sis uolo, ‘I’d rather have you boiled ’.

1116. exempla, &c., ‘I will make an example of you‘.

quia. placeo, &c.‚ ‘you like me and so you would make others copy
me ' (as if Theoropides had said cx te exemplum expetam). For exem-
plum expetere cf. 103, 763.

1 119. aliud, ‘ about something different'.

ergo, ‘well' ; cf. Aul. 322f. STR. casnm ego, non furem roge.
CON. cocum ergo dico, ‘ Well, 1 am speaking of a cook '.

Enter Callidamates (right), who in a brief soliloquy explains the
object of his coming, and then crosses the stage to greet Theoropides.

1122. edormiui crapulam: cf. Rud. 586 ut edormiscam hanc crapu-
lam, Cic. Phil. ΙΙ. 12. 30 edormi crapulam et exhala.

1 1 27. conciliarem, ‘ procure ’.

eccum here forms a complete sentence, as in 560: contrast the
parenthetical use in 83 (where see note). Similarly Pers. 738 f. atque
optume eccum (psum, ‘ here he is himself in the nick of time ’ ; cf. 686.
1128. aduenis: cf. on 29.
1129. cenes τ cena3 see on 388, and for the invitation on 1004.
sic face, ‘please d0!' often used in pressing a person to accept
an invitation, e. g. Stich. 185, 473.

1130. di te ament, is no more than a formula of greeting, like our

‘good morning’; cf. 341, 717, 806.

de cena facio gratiam, ‘ your dinner Ι decline with thanks '.
The phrase gratiam facere alicui alicuius rei or (less often) de aliqua
re means ‘ to renounce something in favour of some one '‚ and like the
English ‘to make a present οἷ’, may be used either literally (‘to give
up’) or as=‘to let off 'z Cas. 372 de istac Casina huic nostro nilico
gratiam facias, Pseud. 1317 non audes mihi gratiam facere buius
argenti (hinc de argento A) 3 Rud. 1414, Sallust, Cat. LII. 8 mihi nullius
umquam delicti gratiam fe’cissem (‘ should not have granted myself an
indulgence for’), Jug. CIV. 5; translated literally but incorrectly into
Greek Pseud. 712 χάριν τούτῳ ποιῶ.

1131. quin uenis? : present of resolve; see 011 343.

113²· etiam, ‘ actually '‚ cf. Amph. 376, 571, and on 383, 522, which
instances are both different.
