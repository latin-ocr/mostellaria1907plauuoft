828-840] NOTES 127

barbare i.e. latine, Capt. 492 barbarica lege=Roman law, barbaricae
urbes=Latin cities, ibid. 884; for puls or pulmentum as the diet of the
early Romans see Juvenal XIV. 171, Varro L. L. V. 105, Plin. H. N.
XVIII. 8, 19 [83]: or, as Scaliger thought, barbarus=Carilzaginian3
so too Ussing, who compares Poen. Prol. 54 where Pultzpkagonidesz
Carthaginian, and shows from Cato R. R. that Carthaginian woodwork
was well known in Greece and Italy, and that puls was also known at
Carthage as an article of diet. That the Carthaginians were skilled
carpenters proves notsshing; so perhaps were the Romans.

829. quam arte dormiunt, ‘ what fast sleepers they are '. Dormire
is also applied to an inanimate object in Cure. 153 ut dormiunt pessuli
pessumi, but Tranio employs the word here as descriptive of the
unsuspicious state of the two old men. For similar intentional and
sels-corrected mistakes cf. Mil. 27, 819, Rud. 4² 3, Amph. 384, &c.

830. fflud quidem, &c. ‘What I meant to say was, how impene-
trable!‘ Tranio again uses a word of ambiguous sense: coniuent=
(i) ‘ to close up' (generally), (ii) ‘ to blink with the eyes ’.

831. quidquidzquidque (indes.), as frequently in old Lat„ e. g.
Aul. 198 ubi quicquid tetigerunt, tenent, Luer. II. 95¹7, IV. 145, &e.‚
Catull. 68. 28 quisquis (masc.) de meliore nola. Com-ersely quisque:
quisquis (relative) in Capt. 798 quemque findere, Men. 717, Mil. 156,
160, &c. Compare quandocumque indes. in Hor. Sat. Ι. 9. 33, quandoque
relative in Hor. A. P. 359.

832. piceum, neut. of the perf. part. pass. ; lit. ‘ do you see it painted
up where '‚ &e.‚ cf. Asin. 174 nam neque fictum usquamst neque pictum
neque scriptum in poematis Ι ubi, διο. ; Men. 143.

cornix, a type of sagacity (cf. the proverb cornici oculum con-
figere), here standing for Tranio himself.

, nonni-ina, a type of rapacity (cf. Trin. 101, Capt. 844), standing
for the old men. The picture is supposed to be a sresco, like those
found on the walls of houses at Pompeii.

835. ad me, ‘ in my direction'.

836. intuor: cf. cantui 838, tueris Trin. 708, intuitur Capt. 557;
011 the other hand we have optuere 837, optquier 840, Amph. 900,
optuetur Mil. 1271, intueor Rud. 449: cf. on 4² <olere and olere).

837. isto ad uos corresponds to huc ad me (835): note the com-
binatiou of the second pers. sing. imperat. with uos, ‘you and your
companion '. For the adverb isto ‘ thither ' cf. Mil. 455 (MSS.).

839. ut te apsoluam, ‘to have done with you’, ‘pour en finir'.
Theor. is getting irritated: for apsoluere in this sense cf. 652, Aul. 51* 7,
rather differently Epid. 465 te apsoluam breui, ‘I will let you off soon’
Capt. 731 non uno apsoluam die.

840. age, ‘well, well' .cf. Mil. 1024.

ignosco, ‘ 1 make allowances (for you) ’.
aetate, abl. of cause, here=prae aetate, cf. Capt. 808. On the
sense ‘ old age‘ cf. on 196.
