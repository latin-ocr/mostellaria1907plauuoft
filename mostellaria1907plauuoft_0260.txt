1 70 MOSTELLARIA

I notice that in one of the instances cited as an Auskunflffragv there
is an ego (Trin. 981). Another difficulty is that Sjogren s distinctions
do not quite apply when the verb is jacere instead os agere, as he
himself shows (p. 85): quid faciam? is both an Auskunflrfrage and
a Konsultative Frage, and quid facio? does not occur in this sense:
nor does the usage of Terence quite agree with that of Plautus (pp. 83
and 86). The distinction between Auskunflssragen and Konsultative
Fragen seems to me almost too fine drawn;¹ but on one point at any
rate we are agreed, viz. that the term ‘ deliberative ’ is inappropriate to
this class of questions as a whole. Ι will add that some common
name for the whole class is needed to mark it off broadly from qnes-
tions as to a matter of fact. Terms like ‘consultative questions’ and

‘ angry questions' serve only to distinguish the speeies of a genus,
and a brief name for the genus is still to seek.

¹ For instance, in Bacch. 630 we find, in answer to the command
bonum habe animum, the reply unde habeam .-⁹, which would be accord-
ing to Sjogren an Auskunstsfragae but in Rud. 687, in reply to exactly
the same command, we find unde iste animus mi inuenitur ?, which
would be a Konsultatz've Frage, like quid fit? ‘ what is to be done?'
Pseud. 1159, Cist. 769. Sjogren admits, however, that these meanings
easily pass into one another (p. 90).-—It may be added that the use of
the Indic. (quid agv ?) in Plautus, according to Sj'ogren's interpretation,
hardly agrees with that early Latin use of the phrase agone? or ago ? ‚ in
which the sacrificial attendant asked the priest whether he was to strike
the victim, and the priest answered age or hoc age (Varro L. L. VI. 12);
sor the question clearly related to the will, not to the views or opinions,
of the priest. As Ovid says (F asti Ι 322), Semper ‘ agone?' rogat, nec
nisi iussus agit. On this use of ago ἕ) see Postgate in Classical Review,
vol. xv, p. 452, to whom belongs the credit of having first called atten-
tion to the defects of the term ‘ deliberative ' (vol. xiii, p. 414 and p. 683

cf. my note in vol. xvi, p. 166, where I include ‘dubitative ’ in the same
condemnation).
