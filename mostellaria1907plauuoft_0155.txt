49-56] NOTES 69

49. fortunatu’s = fortunatus es. See crit. note on Leo's law, l. 40.

patiunda sunt, ‘ amen ’, ‘ things must be endured ’‚=patiundum
est. The same phrase occurs Amph. 945. The use of the plural where
the singular would have been expected (cf. dignissumumst, 52) is
probably due partly at least to metrical convenience: so may be ex-
plained palam istaec fiunt (for istuc fit) te me odisse Merc. 764, mira
sunt <for mirum est) nisi inuitauit Amph. 283, Trin. 861. Possibly
Plaut. may in some cases have been imitating Greek plurals like ‹iven-t?
ἐστι (e. g. Soph. O. C. 883 ὕβρις, ἀλλ’ ἀνεκτέα, sc. τάδ’ ἐστίν).

51. quasi with inuidere, a colloquial phrase, ‘ yon seem to envy
me, as it were ’‚ somewhat like the English iulgarism ‘ to kind of envy
me ’.

hoe . . . quia, see note on 16.

52. quia for quod, cf. Capt. 15 3 illud dolel, qma nunc remissus est
edundi exercitus, Trin. 290 f. This is the usual construction in Plaut.
after a ‘ verbum affectus ' such as doleo, gaudee, suscenseO, paueo, piget,
pudet, acerbum est, &c. For exceptions see Langen, Beitr'age‚ p. 57.

dignissumumst, ἀξιώτατόν ἐστι, ‘it is quite as it should be ’. Here
we have the sing. ς cf. on 49.

54. miseris modis, ‘ miserably‚’ cf. indiguis modis 1033, multimodis
(=multis modis) 785; cf. also 1146 and on Rud. 147. A similar phrase
is pessumis exemplis 192, cf. 1040.

55. carnuficium, probably an adjective formed from carnifex, like
meretricius 190 from meretrix.

earn. cribrum, ‘you hangman's sieve’‚ i. e. sieve made by the
hangman or executioner. who will turn you into a sieve, by ‘ perforating
your hide ’ (te forabunt 56). ,

quod oredo fore, ¹ as Ι believe you will be ’. Note the omission
of the subject accus. (te) before sore, a favourite Plautine construction.
Sometimes, as in 1079 quia negat nouisse uos, the subj. of the infin. is
the same as the subj. of the governing clause (=se nouisse), cf. 633,
1024: sometimes, as in the present passage, they are different: (ego)
credo (te)sore. So in 272, 278, 420 s.‚ 752, 821, 954, 989, 1139.

56. ita, ‘so thoroughly’, cf. 213, 565, 656, 685, 996.

patibulatum, ‘ gibbeted ’ (cf. on 48 aleatus, &c.), ‘ fastened to the
gibbet’. The patibulum (lit. ‘stretcher'‚ from pateo) was a piece of
wood, fixed, like a milkman‘s yoke, over the shoulders of the slave to be
punished: to this his arms were fastened, cf. Mil. 360 dispessis manibus
patibulum quom habebis and note on dierecte 8. To be fastened to the
patibulum was to undergo the first stage of crucifixion : bean'ng it
the condemned slave was driven, sometimes with whips or goads
(stimulis 57), through the streets to the place of execution ‘ outside the
city wall’ (extra porlam Mil. 359, Pseud. 331; ἔξω τῆς πύλης Epist.
to Hebr. xiii. 12), and there hauled up and fastened, by nails driven
through the feet, to an upright pole called palus, stipes or crux. The
patibulum thus formed the cross beam of the crux. The following
quotation from Nonius 221, 12 Patibulum serat per urbem, deinde affi-
gatur cruci shows clearly what the process was ε see Marquardt,
