vi PREFACE

to the ‘semi-quantitative’ character of Old Latin verse and
their bearing on fundamental questions of prosody‚ such as
the law of ‘ Breves breviantes ’, have been briefly indicated in
an article in the Classical Revz'ew (‘Accent and Quantity in
Plautine Verse,' 1906, vol. xx, pp. 156-9). To set thern
forth in detail in the present edition would have demanded
more space than I had at my disposal ς and Ι have thought
it better to reserve them sor a separate work on metre and
prosody‚ on which I have been engaged for many years.¹
Brief references are, however, made to the above article in
cases where my special views have a bearing on the text
(e. g. note on l. 656). Similarly in regard to the scansion
of ille, nempe, &c., in lines like 210 and 335 α, Ι have con-
tented myself with a reference to an article by Radford in
which the latest discussion of rival theories is contained.²
In the use of ictus-marks in the text Ι have followed the
same principle as in the ‘editio minor' of my Rudens—
a principle which is also adopted in the main by Goetz and
Schoell in their latest edition.3 But these marks are not to
be interpreted as implying dissent from the views of Radford

¹ I shall there take account of much recent work, such as the article
by Jacobsohn (Quaestiones Plautinae metricae el grammaticae), in
which he proves that the verse-ending ῦ-υ-, whether in iambic
senarii or in trochaic septenarii, may be preceded by a ‘ syllaba anceps '
or by hiatus, and further applies the same treatment to the second rise
of the troeh. septen.

² ‘ Plautine synizesis, a study of the phenomena of brevis coalescens:
in T ransactions of tlze American Plu'lological Assoi-iation, 1905 (vol.

Δ xxxvi), pp. 159—61 ; see also the vol. for 1904 (xxxv), p. 44. Radford's

own view as to the pronunciation of the ‘dimoric ' ille, nempe, &c., is
that there was some reduction in the quantitative value of both the
syllables, and that it is not necessary to hold with Skutsch that the
second syllable was entirely dropped. [A fuller study of the question
by the same author has been commenced in the American Journal qs
Philology, 1906 (vol. xxvii), pp. 418-37.]
