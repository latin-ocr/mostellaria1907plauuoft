284-317] CRITICAL NOTES 153

sistent with line 287, which implies that his pleasure is a matter of no

importance.
286. Scan na'm ama· as υυ- (without elision).
287. ei Pylades, for e or te P. Scan with long e, as often in Plautus.
—a te Seyffert ; possibly aps te.
288. aetati Bugge, for aetate P.
289. After this line the MSS. have
Postea nequicquam exornata est bene si morata est male
Pulchrum ornatum turpes mores peius caeno continunt
which are quite unsuitable ln this context, the second lineis transcribed
from Poen. 306.
293. The MSS. have diu (Camerarius duae) after uos.
295. The MSS. have libet at the end of the line (probably from the
end of 2 6
296. P9erliaps read id for idem (- em underlined B2).
302. iam Camerarius, for tam P, which might possibly bear the sense
‘ for ever so long‘; cf. Curc. 171 and, for the ‘ deictic’ use of tam,
Trin. 609 (tam modo, a provincialism=‘ just now ’, ‘only recently’).
If this defence of tam diu is sound, perhaps we ought to read it also
in Capt. 882 in the sense ‘ever so long ago' (to be connected with
subrupuit in the previous line).
¹ 305. After this verse the MSS. have (306)—
Haec qui gaudent gaudeant perpetuo suo semper bono
and then, after 308-
Qui inuident ne umquam eorum quisquam inuideat prosus
commodis
This latter line most editors have put after 306, but Langen has proved
it to be unplaufine, though the sentiment is not unsuitable (cf. Pers. 776 f.):
commoda in Plautus never=‘ advantages’ (cf. on 2 55), and inuidere
takes a dat. of the person only ; prorsus too is obscure. Both lines are
probably interpolations: so Langen.
310. Scan cz'c‘m (ἱππεῖ, without elision.
313-347. The text of this Canticum is confused m the MSS. and the
scansion is often doubtful. It falls metrically into three divisions: —
(A) 313- 319, mostly bacchiac dimeters (υέ- Ι υ--) follou ed by
Reizian cola (xxxa-C: the symbol >< denotes a syllable oyf
which the quantity is indifferent).
(B) 320-335 b, cretic, anapaestic, trochaic and iambic rhythms
intermingled.
(C) 336— —347‚ mostly cretic dimeters followed by trochaic tripodies
catalectic (Lu- υ-’ or 'aru—>-
313 uenzrz' Dousa, for uenire PQ—Plzzlolaclzetem Hermann, cf. 317,
349; this would make the line a bacchiac tetrameter.
316. me male 13¹, me ibi male B2CD‚ but six short syllables' 1n suc-
cession are inadmissible as a form os the bacchius.
317 f. Hiatus at diaeresis. But perhaps these two lines should be
scanned with Goetz· Schoell as trochaic pentapodies. The spelling
comi'sam (with one s) is as well attested' 1n MSS. as comzffissan
