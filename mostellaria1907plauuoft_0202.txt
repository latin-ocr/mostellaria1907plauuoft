116 MOSTELLARIA [6 14-629

Cap t. 856, Mil. 1124, Truc. 230, Poen. 1249 (P), Epid. 455 (P), Bacch.
1049 (codd. Pii). The same construction is certain in Lucilius 1037
(Marx) qum purges, deuellas me atque deuras ?, ibid. 426 quin potius
degat& 936 qum amplexetur?, Lucr. Ι. 798 Sall. Jug. 85. 41, Tac. Ann.
IV. 11, and it occurs also, according to the MSS„ in Cic. de Rep. VI.
14 and de Leg. Ι. 4. 14. [See articles by the present writer in Class.
Rev. XV I. 3, p. 167 and by Morgan in Harvard Studies XII. p. 232 f.
to whom some of the above instances are due. This construction is as
yet unrecognized in Grammars; but it supplies the origin of all sub-
ordinate construetions os quin with the subjunctive· ‚ cf. on 493.]

615. quid ais tu ‘?, ‘ I say1'‚ introducing the question quis illic est?

616. compellat, ‘is dunning’: cf. Hor. Epist. Ι. 7. 34 lzac ego si
compellor imagine, ‘ am brought to book '‚ Sat. ΙΙ. 3. 297.

617. praesenti, ‘to your sace 't cf. 564.

624. istuc quoi sit nomen, ‘to whom that epithet of yours is
‘applied’ (= -quoi istuc nomen tribuas) referring to the word 'danista,
just as in 70 nomen istuc (¹ the name you apply to me ’) refers to ficrczfer
69. When Tranio said uideturne idoneus . . . improbissumumst
(= nonne damsta est germanus. ? or nonne nomen danistae meretur
propter i'mprobztatem suam ξ’) he in effect called the money· -lender a
danista improbus. Hence Theoropides replies: ‘ I don't care to whom
you apply that name or why you apply it ; that is a mere verbal question :
what Ι want to know is what money Philolaches owes him ’. The word
nomen often denotes uocabulum, e.g. ita ut nomen cluet Trin. 4963 in
Cicero exsulis nomen (pro Domo 72), nomen amicitiae, nomen liber-
tatis. &c. For the construction cf. 661.

'vin it’.
gl 62} me scire ε sor accus. with infin. aster expeto cf. Trin. 365.

627. paululum, ‘ a very little ’; the diminutive termination strengthens
the idea of ‘little ’. It also determines the form of the repl')⁷
quantillum Ρ, ‘ a little how much ⁶? ’‚ i.e. ‘ what is the amount of your
little ἶ) ’ But quantillum may also be used without a preceding diminu-
tive, e. g. Cure. 103, Capt. 193, Pseud. 1192, Poen. 1167, Truc. 637:
cf. tantillum Most. 394, pauxillum Capt. 176 (answered by perpauxillum
177), aliquantillum ibid. 137.
