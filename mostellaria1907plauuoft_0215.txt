856. molestum, ‘ tiresome’.

857. haud usquam, here ‘ nowhz‘tlzer’ ; so nusquam Capt. 173,
Cist. 702 ; cf. Trin. 314 ne penetrarem me usquam. Theoropides,
followed by Tranio, enters Simo’s house at the back of the stage, which
is thus left vacant.

The F1FTH CANTICUM (858—903) falls into two parts: (Ay 858-884,
Solo of Phaniscus; (B) 885—903, Duet of Phaniscus and Pinacium.

Enter Phaniscus (right) from the town, in a good humour. He has
come to fetch his master home (cf. on 313 fi), and indulges in some sels-
satisfied reflectione upon the difference between a seruos frug-i and
a seruos nequam : cf. Aul. IV. 1, Men. V. 6.

’ 858. quom, ‘ though ’‚ with the indic„ as usual in Plautus; see
on 2 .
{mlum ι- mala res, 61.

859. utibilis = utilis, lit. ‘ usable ’, with the ordinary passive sense os

(x horm. 90).

860. qui nil metuont, i. e. who are too audacious.

862. reprehensi, ‘ caught and brought back again ’. The word
prop. means ‘to seize from behind' (by the pallium), cf. Trin. 624„

864. faciunt a. malo, &c. 863-869 can no longer be restored with
any success from the corrupted text of the MSS. The first line sounds
like a piece of slaves’ slang, meaning ‘they get perquisites in the shape
of punishment'3 cf. Asin. 277, where aster Leonida has ironically offered
to make a present of the stripes that he has received, Libanus remarks:
largitur peculium .· omnem in tergo thensaurum gerit. But the preposi-
tion a should be de or e and peculio should be peculium.

quod nequeunt is perhaps the beginning of a clause meaning
⁶ because they cannot get perquisites by good behaviour'.

869. sincerum, ‘ unbroken ’‚ ‘ whole‘: cf. Rud. 756 f.

uotem from uoto, an archaic form of ueto, often found in Plautus.
uerberare ιζ MSS.) should be uerberari (passive).

870. si huie imperabo, &c., if genuine, perhaps means ‘if 1 make
this (my back) obey me <by avoiding the whip), Ι shall get a nice roos
to cover it'. Or huic may be his master, and the sense ‘if 1 humour
him so as to rule him ' ; but we should then· expect parebo.

871. malum quom, &c., ‘ when it rains blows on others‘ : cs. on 654.
