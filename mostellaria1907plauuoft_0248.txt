549. Hiatus at caesura; a pause may be made before omnia. cf.1032.
After this line P have 553 and 557- 559, which also recur in their proper
places: deleted here by Acidalius.

5 52· Dixtine Bentley, for Dixtin P; Dixtin ei F ay.

554, 555. Lacuna in P, supplied by Camerarius and Leo.

557. 1 have supplied aecum (cf. A in Epid. 552, 586, Trin. 392) to
avoid hiatus, and written unum for una P. Langen (Beitr. p. 242 ff.)
shows that Plautus does not use una cum in phrases meaning ‘ go to law
with ’, but only the simple curm-For the non-elision of cum before eo
see on 2.

560. 3S9cboell suggests seruolum, in order to avoid hiatus.

562. nequequam Z, nec quoquom P (·quam B2).

567. Hiatus at argento justified by change of speakers, as frequently
iu every place of every kind of verse, cf. 392, 398, 586, 718, 798, 821,

48, 952, 1175·

Gu et.

5y83 a. modo domum Ritschl (cf. Luchs in Studemund’s Studien, 1.
p. 50), DOMUM A, modo P (cf. 583 b).

583 b. This line appears in A only, which has at the beginning
either ATUOLO 01· NON EO. The third letter may therefore be an
N. The letter before FAENU<S) looks like an M; hence my reading
At nolo, priusquam faenus (the sentence being interrupted by Tranio:
cf. 849).—Studernund suggested saster Non ειη) prz'u's da faenus, Seyffert
(after At uolo) mihi prius des faenus: but the singular number seems
out of place; cf. 584 date and nugamini3 589 f.

593. tun supplied by Ritschl ; cf. Asin. 104-106, 521—524‚ Poen.
990, Pseud. 615 f. Or supply homo after tu; cf. Bacch. 1155 a, Men.

in Plautus; cf. 183, 615, 943, 959, 1034 —OMNIUM KOMINUMA:

600. preserved in A only.

601. Such lines as this and Men. 101 are appealed to by Lindsay
(Lat. Lang.‚ p. 457) as evidence that dat was a naturally long
syllable in Plautus. And certainly the line runs better if the fourth
rise is formed by dat alone (not by ddt ἄ· -). But the rise before the
verse· ·ending— υ-υ- (see Pref. p. vi, ynote 1) may be short3 cf. Rud. 900.
